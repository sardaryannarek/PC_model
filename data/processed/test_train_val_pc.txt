A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?
A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.
Now, if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated, that's great; they should seem familiar.
This work is 15 years old.
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii, director of the Tangible Media Group.
But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell, one of the world's legendary production designers.
But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,
and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film.
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude, the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable, that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&D effort.
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual.
People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report" when they talk about new UI design.
So this led full circle, in a strange way, to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface: the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.
So here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.
And, using a hand, we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom, six degrees of navigational control.
And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan.
And that's all well and good.
Let's do something a little more difficult.
Here, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.
We can fly around them.
So navigation is a fundamental issue.
You have to be able to navigate in 3D.
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial.
And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.
So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.
We can organize it this way.
And, of course, it's not just about navigation, but about manipulation as well.
So if we don't like stuff, or we're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications, we can pull them out like that.
And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution.
Let's just come down a bit and fly around.
So that's a different way to look at stuff.
If you're of a more analytical nature then you might want, actually, to look at this as a color histogram.
So now we've got the stuff color-sorted, angle maps onto color.
And now, if we want to select stuff, 3D, space, the idea that we're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in, not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.
Here are some selection planes.
And we'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.
So, from there to the world of real work.
Here's a logistics system, a small piece of one that we're currently building.
There're a lot of elements.
And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information.
So here's a familiar place.
And we'll bring this back here for a second.
Maybe select a little bit of that.
And bring out this graph.
And we should, now, be able to fly in here and have a closer look.
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States.
One thing that three-dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.
That's the old way, that's the old mantra: one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.
Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore.
In the real world, we have people who collaborate; we have people who have to work together,
and we have many different displays.
And we might want to look at these various images.
We might want to ask for some help.
The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there, so I can pull this from there to there.
These are unrelated machines, right?
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble.
So I'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul.
Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.
So let me get some of these out of the way.
Let's pull this apart:
I'll go ahead and explode it.
Kevin, can you help?
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board.
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise, but we do it in the lab all the time.
All right.
So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located or distant and distinct, is always important.
And again, that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space.
And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery.
This is a system called TAMPER, which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be.
We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form.
So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here.
And let's just pick out a few elements. We can zip through them as a possibility.
We can grab elements off the front, where upon they reanimate, come to life, and drag them down onto the table here.
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well.
We may need more than one.
And we probably need, well, we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest.
Yeah, let's take that one.
You see, cowboys and French farce people don't go well together, and the system knows that.
Let me leave with one final thought,
and that is that of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift.
And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars], or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer; he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence.
And I think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology.
Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity, and we need to demand that, in fact.
For some of this kind of technology, ground center is a combination of design, which is crucially important.
We can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start.
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency.
We're, as human beings, the creatures that create, and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image.
So I will leave you with that. Thank you. Chris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question -- actually this is from Bill Gates -- when?
CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?
JU: No, it has to be for every human being.
That's our goal entirely.
We won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step.
I mean it's been 25 years.
Can there really be only one interface? There can't.
CA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home, you need projectors, cameras?
You know, how can it work?
JU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.
It'll be built into architecture.
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years.
So this is the inevitability about it.
CA: So, in your mind, five years time, someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface?
JU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer, you'll get this.
CA: Well that's cool.
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?
JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.
At the moment, our early-adopter customers -- and these systems are deployed out in the real world -- do all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.
So, whether it's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction, financial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics, those are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.
And I understand what you're asking.
CA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.
John, thank you for making science-fiction real.
JU: It's been a great pleasure.
Thank you to you all.
Speaking at the most recent EG conference, author, philosopher, prankster and journalist A.J. Jacobs talks about the year he spent living biblically -- following the rules in the Bible as literally as possible.
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.
And I see my life as a series of experiments.
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life," where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me.
So, they answered my emails.
They answered my phone.
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.
It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.
It was a wonderful experience.
More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty.
And this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.
And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth.
So, I decided I would try this for a month.
This was the worst month of my life.
I do not recommend this at all.
To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."
So, that was hard.
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All," and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.
It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.
But I love that one, because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb.
Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.
You can just Google it.
So, I wasted some time there.
I love those experiments, but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible, "The Year of Living Biblically."
And I undertook this for two reasons.
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
So, not very.
But I've become increasingly interested in religion.
I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones.
And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.
So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.
The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.
So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally, without picking and choosing.
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.
I had Christian bibles.
I had Jewish bibles.
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that," as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."
Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find.
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.
So I wanted to follow those.
And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously.
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.
There is the law in Leviticus, "You cannot shave the corners of your beard."
I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end.
As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.
My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.
So, certainly the challenge was there.
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."
You only know if you try it.
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off.
So, I wanted to follow that rule.
That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip.
So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.
You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying -- you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.
But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts.
This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person.
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind, and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.
You change your behavior, and you change your mind.
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate.
You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause.
So, it really was cognitive psychology -- you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology, very primitive cognitive psychology.
In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier, which, as we know, is actually true.
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America.
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.
But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it.
So, I was able to stone one adulterer.
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.
And this man came up to me and he said, "Why are you dressed like that?"
And I explained my project, and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"
And I said, "Well, that would be great!"
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand.
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.
He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could -- eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others?
How should we view the Bible?
Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?
How was the Bible written?
And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years.
And it's sort of evolved.
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year.
The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.
This became very, very clear, early on.
Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person, and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example. Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.
It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around.
So, you know, I met with creationists.
I went to the creationists' museum.
And these are the ultimate literalists.
And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.
It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model.
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.
They really did a fantastic job.
If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.
So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy -- they did a great job.
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.
But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong.
So, this is actually a key to happiness for me, is to just remember when I came over here, the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.
It's a remarkable thing.
Third, that thou shall have reverence.
This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic, and by the end of the year, I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.
And I'm trying to start it as a movement.
So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred.
The Sabbath can be sacred.
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.
So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.
Thou shall not stereotype.
This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey.
I wanted it to be about religion in America.
So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.
I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness. After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, "I gotta go."
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you. Bless you, bless you.
But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.
There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians, and they focus on the red words in the Bible, which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.
They have a pamphlet that says, "Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality," and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.
So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people.
So, this was very inspiring to me.
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.
They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say.
Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.
This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces.
And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed.
Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people "Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"
And they said, "We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning."
And I would say, "But that's crazy."
And they would say, "Well, what about you?
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'"
So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.
So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed.
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.
And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible.
And I failed miserably.
Because you can't.
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing.
The key is to pick and choose the right parts.
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.
You're just picking and choosing."
But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"
I've had some great meals at cafeterias.
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well.
So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.
There's me reading the Bible.
That's how I hailed taxicabs.
Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.
So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
Clay Shirky looks at "cognitive surplus" -- the shared, online work we do with our spare brain cycles. While we're busy editing Wikipedia, posting to Ushahidi , we're building a better, more cooperative world.
The story starts in Kenya in December of 2007, when there was a disputed presidential election,
and in the immediate aftermath of that election, there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh -- who some of you may know from her TEDTalk -- who began blogging about it on her site, Kenyan Pundit.
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence, the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout.
And so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was.
And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on.
The comments began pouring in,
and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.
And she quickly said, "It's too much.
I could do this all day every day and I can't keep up.
There is more information about what's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage.
If only there was a way to automate this."
And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said, "We could do that,"
and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness" or "testimony" in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field, whether it's from the web or, critically, via mobile phones and SMS, aggregating it and putting it on a map.
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed
because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is, but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it, and it maps it and it makes it public.
And that, that maneuver called "crisis mapping," was kicked off in Kenya in January of 2008.
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform.
It's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud.
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.
And it's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake.
And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page, you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide, all right?
This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of 2008 to a global deployment in less than three years.
Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology.
What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity.
And the interesting moment now, the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true.
That is the resource that I'm talking about.
I call it cognitive surplus.
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large, sometimes global, projects.
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things.
The first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.
The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects.
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century, but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.
That's the second half of cognitive surplus.
The media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume,
and we got, as a result, very good at consuming.
But now that we've been given media tools -- the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume, what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be.
We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us.
We still like to consume, of course.
But it turns out we also like to create, and we like to share.
And it's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource.
And using cognitive surplus, we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific, literary, artistic, political efforts.
Designing.
We're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions.
And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.
This is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.
Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say, that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act.
There are other candidates of course, but LOLcats will do as a general case.
But here's the thing: The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act.
Someone who has done something like this, however mediocre and throwaway, has tried something, has put something forward in public.
And once they've done it, they can do it again, and they could work on getting it better.
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,
and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows, it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of.
The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing.
And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap.
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats, right, to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.
But media abundance never works that way.
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.
Even with the sacred printing press, we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals.
So before I talk about what is, I think, the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi, I want to talk about their shared source. And that source is design for generosity.
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around, social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us, how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them, or because we're being paid to do them.
This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini, who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade, what they called "deterrence theory."
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:
If you want somebody to do less of something, add a punishment and they'll do less of it.
Simple, straightforward, commonsensical -- also, largely untested.
And so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.
They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension, which is pick-up time.
At pick-up time the teachers, who have been with your children all day, would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.
Meanwhile, the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late.
So Gneezy and Rustichini said, "How many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers?"
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is, these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals -- that there were between six and 10 instances of late pick-ups on average in these 10 daycare centers.
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.
The white group there is the control group; they change nothing.
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line, they said, "We are changing this bargain as of right now.
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late, we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts."
And the minute they did that, the behavior in those daycare centers changed.
Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average, and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine.
And you can see immediately what happened, right?
The fine broke the culture of the daycare center.
By adding a fine, what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels, and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers.
And so the parents, quite sensibly, said, "10 shekels to pick my kid up late?
What could be bad?"
The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,
and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints.
But that's not right.
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones.
And critically, the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did.
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."
And then a really interesting thing happens:
Nothing changes.
The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed.
Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible, that incompatibility can persist over long periods.
So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain, when you're really designing for generosity.
This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi.
This is, I think, the range that matters.
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus.
Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share.
Here is the critical difference between these:
LOLcats is communal value.
It's value created by the participants for each other.
Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere --
every time you see a large aggregate of shared, publicly available data, whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever.
This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy, maybe a little more even,
but this is also a largely solved problem.
I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying, "Where, oh where, can I find a picture of a cute cat?"
Ushahidi, by contrast, is civic value.
It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole.
The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants, but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating.
And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation.
It really is going to be a side effect of what we, collectively, make of these kinds of efforts.
There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs.
That will be true year-in and year-out.
The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow,
and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead --
a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.
What's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said, the inventor and entrepreneur.
Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."
We've got a choice before us.
We've got this trillion hours a year.
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.
That, we get for free.
But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value.
And to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that, we'll be able to change society.
Thank you very much.
The tale of a major global cultural phenomenon: Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle describes the spectacular arrival of fast-paced 20-20 cricket as it parallels the rise of modern India. He traces the game from its sleepy English roots to the current world of celebrity owners and million-dollar player contracts.
So, what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's -- maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera, which is cricket.
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:
It's got love, joy, happiness, sadness, tears, laughter, lots of deceit, intrigue.
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes.
And that's exactly what cricket has done.
It's jumped 20 years into 20-over game.
And that's what I'm going to talk about, how a small change leads to a very big revolution.
But it wasn't always like that.
Cricket wasn't always this speed-driven generations game.
There was a time when you played cricket, you played timeless test matches, when you played on till the game got over.
And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March.
And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town, which is a two-hour train journey, to catch the ship that left on the 17th, because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.
So, the match was ended in between.
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?
Another half an hour and we would have won."
Another half an hour after 12 days.
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,
so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,
so they all sat around making friends with each other.
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket: because we had about the same pace of life.
The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?
You fought by day, then it was sunset, so everyone went back home.
And then you worked out your strategy, and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.
Princes patronize the game, not because they love the game, but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers.
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which was, all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball, and any number of people could play it anywhere.
Take a look:
You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there,
you could play it in a little alley --
you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;
don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --
that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land, even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.
As you can see, you can play anywhere.
But slowly the game moved on, you know, finally.
You don't always have five days. So, we moved on, and we started playing 50-over cricket.
And then an enormous accident took place.
In Indian sport we don't make things happen,
accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.
And we won this World Cup in 1983.
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,
and we played it virtually every day.
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.
But there was another big date.
1983 was when we won the World Cup.
1991,'92, we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India, rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country.
And so we allowed multinationals into India.
We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,
and we got all the multinationals coming in, with multinational budgets, who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India, and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.
The scripted one is what you see in the movies,
the real one was cricket.
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me, Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it all over the world.
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.
And so cricket started becoming big;
cricket started bringing riches in.
Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said, "We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it."
Then they said, "OK,
the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars." So, it's a bit of a curve, that.
And then another big accident happened in our cricket.
England invented 20 overs cricket, and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.
Thank God for them.
And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.
India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.
And then something very dramatic happened.
We got to the final, and then this moment, that will remain enshrined forever, for everybody, take a look.
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.
Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!
What a match for a Twenty20 final.
India, the world champions.
India, T20 champions.
But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.
A massive, massive success:
India, the world TT champions.
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast.
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go, but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game.
And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.
It was at a time when investment was coming in, India was feeling a little more confident about itself.
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do.
And thankfully for all of us, the English are very good at inventing things,
and then the gracious people that they are, they let the world become very good at it.
And so England invented T20 cricket, and allowed India to hijack it.
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine, we just took it straight away, as is.
And so, we launched our own T20 league.
Six weeks, city versus city.
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country, representing itself on the field.
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.
The other was Indian cricket.
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.
But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West.
America is a home of leagues. And they said, "Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."
But was India ready for it?
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice, simple family game.
All of a sudden, you had that happening.
An opening ceremony to match every other.
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over.
So, it was a different India.
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern, but didn't want to say that to people.
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it; these were people who ran serious companies.
And so they started promoting cricket big time, started promoting clubs big time.
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled,
1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years, and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,
but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.
But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized.
So, just to give you an example of how they did it -- not Manchester United style promotion, but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.
Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."
But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.
All along, if you wanted a young cricketer, you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality, your own city, and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers.
Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot -- if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example, they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them, they could go to Trinidad.
This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world, where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price.
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world.
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago, overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."
We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave; it's about when do you have to reach there?"
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one." So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game, went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport, sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal, second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.
Never would India have thought on this scale before.
Never would India have said, "I want a player to play one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica to play a game."
And I just thought to myself, "Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."
But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket, which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.
There is cricket and the movies.
And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs.
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.
And something very interesting happened.
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team -- as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well, you got a hug from Preity Zinta.
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --
everyone's watching Preity Zinta.
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata, but we'd never seen anything like this:
Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.
But take a look at this.
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata.
Can you imagine?
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?
"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."
But I thought I'd take this opportunity -- there's a few people from Pakistan in here.
I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?
We can play cricket together, we can be friends.
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.
There was criticism too because they said, "Players are being bought and sold?
Are they grain?
Are they cattle?"
Because we had this auction, you see.
How do you fix a price for a player?
And so the auction that followed literally had people saying, "Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."
There it is.
Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match, but if you finish in four days you only got 200. The best Indian players who played every test match -- every one of the internationals, the top of the line players -- standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England, he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said, "For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.
Could you have imagined that day would come?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.
That's not bad, is it?
So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking itself against the best in the world, and it became a huge brand.
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.
IPL became the biggest brand in India and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa, and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.
But we did it. You know why?
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event, and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.
Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem, suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching -- the huge consuming class -- everybody came to watch the cricket.
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.
Now, this last minute before I go -- there's a couple of side effects of all this.
For a long time, India was this country of poverty, dust, beggars, snake charmers, filth,
Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
And that felt good, you know?
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,
everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game.
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end, or you can't take it all over the world.
So that's what T20 is doing.
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Dan Gilbert presents research and data from his exploration of happiness -- sharing some surprising tests and experiments that you can also try on yourself. Watch through to the end for a sparkling Q&A with some familiar TED faces.
We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift.
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is, and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.
But the simple English translation -- much less precise, but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this: The expected value of any of our actions -- that is, the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things: the odds that this action will allow us to gain something, and the value of that gain to us.
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is, if we can estimate and multiply these two things, we will always know precisely how we should behave.
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five, and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses, but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
People are horrible at estimating both of these things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today.
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do, and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed, and errors in estimating the value of their own success.
Now, let me talk about the first one first.
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy: there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads.
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more -- I should say, lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined.
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford.
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs, not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind, then dogs on leashes are more probable.
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.
Are there more four-letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place?
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan, and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung, and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place.
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.
It's like the dictionary; it's hard to look things up by the third letter.
So, this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens.
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.
Compare these to the actual numbers.
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all, two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks. Two things are vastly underestimated: dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
It's not interesting because it's so common.
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result, we vastly underestimate them.
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case of people's ability to compute probabilities.
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way, doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost?
Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say, "Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television -- no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss, and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win, you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery: imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy.
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left. Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed, but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody," because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value: trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it, how much pleasure it will give us.
I want to talk now about errors in value.
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?
Most of you have the intuition that it's not -- you wouldn't pay that for it.
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one, and only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars?
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food, but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat, you think, I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country, and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no, before I'd even told you anything about the context?
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking, "What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment to other possible investments, you compared to the past.
And this is a systematic error people make.
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
For example, this is, of course, one of the most delicious tricks in marketing, is to say something used to be higher, and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K, a job where you're getting a salary cut each year, and one in which you're getting a salary increase, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why?
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example.
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600. Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week.
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week.
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions.
Imagine that you're going to the theater.
You're on your way to the theater.
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars. You also have a 20-dollar bill.
When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
Most people answer, no.
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
You're on your way to the theater, and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?
Now, just in case you're not getting it, here's a schematic of what happened, OK?
Along the way, you lost something.
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
What the hell difference should it make?
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself, I'm not paying twice for the same thing.
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value.
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past, we still make certain kinds of mistakes.
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.
One of the things we know about comparison: that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum, didn't seem like such a great guy.
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course, and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money.
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine, and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?
Most people don't want the most expensive, they don't want the least expensive.
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.
So I'm telling you something you already knew: namely, that comparison changes the value of things.
Here's why that's a problem: the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home, it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value, where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things, are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example.
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions: How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
Namely, those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty; those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty.
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience.
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question: You want to buy a car stereo.
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
Most people say they would.
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! -- doesn't know where it came from.
It doesn't know what you saved it on.
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go, I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or, I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment, but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons, because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you're making, but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
You've all had this experience.
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.
And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown, and you thought, "Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't, these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them, and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner, and what do you find?
Compared to your regular friends, they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context, the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers -- these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers, and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better.
And so you buy them, and you bring them home, and you entirely violate the décor of your house.
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again.
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go, "Sounds so much better than those little ones," which you can't even remember hearing.
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time.
People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time.
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules.
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem and then a third, hard, problem.
Here's the first easy problem:
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is, we believe more is better than less.
Here's the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
Again, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later.
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict. For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting, but you have to be patient.
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months.
What do we find now?
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12, they might as well wait 13.
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year.
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?
These guys can tell us.
What you see here are two lads, one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon, and I want you to notice two things.
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch, then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.
Here are the results of what I just showed you.
This is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points.
And I want you to see that two things are true. One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look; and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved.
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you: 60 now or 50 in a month?
And these are subjective values, and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.
People always think more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50, and they always think now is better than later:
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.
Watch what happens when we drop some out.
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that when people get to the future, they will change their minds.
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
I'll take the 50 dollars now.
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this: If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:
namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups, rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves, had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.
We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands.
We have no significant predators, we're the masters of our physical environment; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us.
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions.
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in 1738, because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: That was remarkable.
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us, and is there some way that we could counteract that?
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events, and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified, rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to -- and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
We already know, for example, in the United States, more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways, than were killed in 9/11. OK?
If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year, you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play, the kind of coverage, that they do.
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
Talk more about it.
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.
If Australia disappears tomorrow, terror is probably the right response.
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand, when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country.
Is terror the right response?
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular?
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
What is it?
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us -- it's not a tree falling on us by accident.
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can.
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know,
go to Israel. And a mall blows up, and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on.
And as the Israeli mother said, she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."
I mean, this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it, shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.
CA: But is there a rational fear that actually, the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come?
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened.
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."
That's not my point at all.
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally, our distress about things that happen, about threats, should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come.
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said, Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
There are no guns going off.
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?
That's a tough one.
CA: There's no question.
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude, unless someone can show that there's, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
The latest I've read, seen, thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly, but with poverty it's a bit -- DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.
CA: We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past, in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth,
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things?
People died; so be it.
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.
And so we evolved these responses.
Is that what happened?
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation, you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different.
And there's a good reason to be, because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before, our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated.
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it. Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of, which is the error of value.
I know, because I've interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
That's what you think it is. All right?
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose, and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost.
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment, you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
Now, economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses, which is: this is just a bunch of stupid people.
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is, we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember, people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either, even though they don't feel great during the drawing.
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win. I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,
which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
But certainly I see your point: that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
CA: Last question.
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it, as we'll all hear tomorrow.
I very much resonate with what you're saying, because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
DG: For you or for them?
AdG: In persuading them.
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future.
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future, people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way.
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65 is a question that's very different than, imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living, what will you look like, how much hair will you have, who will you be living with.
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario, suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money.
But these are tricks around the margins. I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency, which is to say, "I'm here today, and so now is more important than later." CA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience, that was a fantastic session. Thank you.
Software developer Mike Matas demos the first full-length interactive book for the iPad -- with clever, swipeable video and graphics and some very cool data visualizations to play with. The book is "Our Choice," Al Gore's sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth."
So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.
It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis.
The book starts like this. This is the cover.
As the globe spins, we can see our location,
and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.
Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.
So you can open this one.
AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
MM: It starts playing immediately.
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.
But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power.
This is one of my favorites.
So this shows ...
When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery.
And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
It also runs on the iPhone.
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.
And it works the exact same way.
You can pinch into any page.
Open it up.
So that's Push Pop Press' first title,
Al Gore's "Our Choice."
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
What is the business here?
Is this something that other people can do?
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text.
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
All right. Mike, thanks so much.
MM: Thank you.
Filmmaker Newton Aduaka shows clips from his powerful, lyrical feature film "Ezra," about a child soldier in Sierra Leone.
This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:
I usually stand on the other side of the light, and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
The previous speaker has, I think, really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss, and trying to find the answer to the big questions.
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this, feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti, who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know, studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
What have you done with so many years of being away?
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?
And we expected huge masterpieces!"
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --
just in a reduced, small version.
In a way, I feel like that.
I feel like I’m coming home to talk about what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.
And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:
a handful of films -- nothing much, two feature films and a handful of short films.
So, we’ll go with the first piece.
Court: Sleep. Court: Where? Woman: Nigeria. Court: Never. couldn’t afford it. Boy: What do you do all day?
Marcus: Read.
Boy: Don't you get bored?
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?
Marcus: I am retired.
Boy: So?
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.
Marcus: Because I do what I like?
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.
Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?
Boy: Yeah.
Marcus: A modern day poet.
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.
Marcus: So what do you talk about?
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
Boy: Reality, man.
Marcus: Whose reality?
Boy: My fuckin' reality.
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --
Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
Marcus: With an AK-47?
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities, it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.
Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.
Marcus: The Panthers.
Boy: Panthers?
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.
Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?
Épuise, right? Woman 1: Yes. Let’s go. W1: They suck. Dream about bullshit. Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me, and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria, that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home. And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
I've been away 20 years in total.
And so it’s really -- it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997, which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship, the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated.
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,
the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,
and his reality.
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
And what would a child -- what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think, I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him? What happens with that?
What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,
and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well, France is a liberal society."
But I lived in England for 18 years. I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually thrown back 20 years, living in France.
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question: What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.
I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me.
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966, a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years and it was three years of war.
So that whole thing, that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.
Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.
Onicha: Yes, mama.
Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle, so you must get ready and willing to die.
You must get -- ?
Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.
C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
CS: The barrel of the gun!
C: This is the gun.
CS: This is the gun.
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
Amphetamines.
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
We went from one village to another -- three villages.
I don’t remember how we got there.
Witness: We walked and walked for two days.
We didn't eat.
There was no food, just little rice.
Without food -- I was sick.
The injection made us not to have mind.
God will forgive us.
He knows we did not know. We did not know!
Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?
Ezra: I don’t remember.
Various Voices: You will die! You will die!
Onicha: Ezra!
Various Voices: ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ No more trouble ♫ They killed my mother.
The Mende sons of bastards.
Who is she?
Me.
Why you giving these to me?
So you can stop staring at me.
My story is a little bit complicated.
I’m interested.
Mariam is pregnant.
You know what you are? A crocodile.
Big mouth. Short legs.
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.
He’s not taking care of his troops.
Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.
Open your eyes, Ezra.
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫ Get that idiot out!
I take you are preparing a major attack?
This must be the mine.
Your girl is here.
Well done, well done.
That is what you are here for, no?
You are planning to go back to fight are you?
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ No more trouble ♫ ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ No more trouble. ♫ Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!
♫ We don't need no more ... ♫ Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
More than that, begin a healing process and finally to -- as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.
The beginning of hope.
Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.
State your name and age for the commission.
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.
I am 15 or 16. I don’t remember.
Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here for any crimes you committed.
E: We were fighting for our freedom.
If killing in a war is a crime, then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
You too are a retired General, not so?
CC: Yes, correct.
E: So you too must stand trial then.
Our government was corrupt.
Lack of education was their way to control power.
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
E: You are richer than us.
But we pay for school.
Your country talks about democracy,
but you support corrupt governments like my own.
Why? Because you want our diamond.
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
No.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.
You are not on trial.
E: Then let me go.
CC: I can't do that, son.
E: So you are a liar.
NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here, is that while we’re making all these huge advancements, what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should -- Africa should move forward, but we should remember, so we do not go back here again.
Thank you.
Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.
One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers.
And considering where you are coming from, and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously as it should be, what would you have to say about that?
NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-combatants, as they like to be called.
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them. I met psychiatrists who spent time with them, aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip, I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself, if any kid in the West, in the western world, went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through, they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
So for me, the thought that we have all these children -- it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,
and Africa has to live with that.
But I’m just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement.
That’s really my thinking.
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.
That was a very moving piece.
NA: Thank you.
EO: Thank you.
In a wildly entertaining discussion with Richard Saul Wurman, architect Frank Gehry gives TEDsters his take on the power of failure, his recent buildings, and the all-important “Then what?” factor.
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning. Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist.
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set
and I decided to make water.
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,
and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in.
And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back
and I was about 15 feet away.
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion.
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay.
RSW: ... huh. I'd like to start this session again.
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous, Frank Gehry. And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing. I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time. I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,
but your building is an icon --
you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --
and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
And I know the road was extremely difficult.
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big.
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody.
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.
A lot of us work for people;
we're in the hands of other people.
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session -- it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.
And you've achieved that
and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it. It's a big issue.
FG: Well, I've always just ... I've never really gone out looking for work.
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff.
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars. But I couldn't do anything else.
That was my response to the people in the time.
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.
I think it was circumstantial.
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it. And a few people got excited about it.
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
He's building this huge concrete place.
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
We were standing out in the desert all alone and, thinking about my house, he said, "Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent, somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money, so the stuff was a little more permanent.
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,
this guy was telling us the other day.
So where do we go now?
Back to -- everything's so temporary.
I don't see it the way you characterized it.
For me, every day is a new thing.
I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --
if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it. I discard it.
So I approach it with the same trepidation.
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK.
I do run a kind of a business --
I've got 120 people
and you've got to pay them,
so there's a lot of responsibility involved --
but the actual work on the project is with, I think, a healthy insecurity.
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure.
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it, I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
They weren't mistakes;
I saw everything that I would have changed
and I was embarrassed by it.
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street, and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it.
RSW: What's the status of the New York project?
FG: I don't really know.
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me, and I thought he was nuts. I didn't think he knew what he was doing,
and he pulled it off.
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
They're still talking about it.
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero,
and I'm totally against that.
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero
I think for a long time.
RSW: The picture on the screen, is that Disney?
FG: Yeah.
RSW: How much further along is it than that, and when will that be finished?
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October --
and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place.
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me.
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients.
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings.
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?
And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him.
He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
I knew Craig and respected him.
They want to add to it
and it's hard to add to a building like that --
it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff
and it's a lot of acreage.
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal: Alvaro Siza. RSW: Why did you want that?
FG: I knew you'd ask that question. It was intuitive. Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work,
and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,
and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that.
I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off,
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ... I just stopped.
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me.
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building.
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you.
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art.
Did you see that thing?
RSW: No. What did he say?
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing." FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.
It's a richer experience.
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --
it's similar to that I would imagine --
where you ... huh?
Audience: Liquid architecture.
FG: Liquid architecture.
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city. RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?
Or is it going to be down near ... FG: No, it's near the current campus.
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.
It's not his money, of course. RSW: What's his schedule on that?
FG: I don't know.
What's the schedule, Richard?
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004. FG: 2004.
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right?
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment, and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other, you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect. Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era.
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.
That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it.
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.
FG: But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context, I'm worried about the city, I'm worried about my client, I worry about budget, that I'm on time."
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.
You're not going to defy gravity.
You've got to work with the building department. If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak. I was so proud.
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.
I met them in Bilbao.
They came for three days.
RSW: This is the computer building?
FG: Yeah, the computer building.
They were there three days and it rained every day
and they kept walking around --
I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things,
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?
People put buckets out ...
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,
it was just fantastic.
But you've got to -- yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ... RSW: Frank had a sort of ... FG: Ask Miriam!
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.
FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story, when the woman called and said, "Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head." And he said, "Madam, move your chair." So, some years later I was doing a building, a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,
and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady, called me and said, "Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head." And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.
FG: No. Not now either.
But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"
OK, you solved all the problems,
you did all the stuff, you made nice,
you loved your clients,
you loved the city,
you're a good guy, you're a good person ...
and then what?
What do you bring to it?
And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city.
That's what reminded me of it.
And I think that's the issue, you know;
it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that.
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,
be polite,
and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ... FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
RSW: Did it leak?
FG: No.
RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?
FG: Yeah.
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years, both Krens and I have been called
with at least 100 opportunities --
China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --
to come in and do the Bilbao effect.
And I've met with some of these people.
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned
and they get you for at least one or two meetings.
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city,
and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port. I asked them what kind of building it was.
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.
So four of us went.
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay,
and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor.
Each one was more beautiful than the other.
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga.
Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner.
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys.
We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet.
And the guy looked at me and said, "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"
RSW: Oh, my God.
FG: So, I got up.
I said to my team, "Let's get out of here." We stood up, we walked out.
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said, "You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"
I said, "Nope." "You're not going to have dinner at all?" They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project.
And we get a lot of that.
Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel.
I don't have my own plane yet.
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long.
But let me just say a couple words.
FG: Can I say something?
Are you going to talk about me or you?
RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ... RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!
I'm going to make it for you!
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!
From the TED archives: The legendary graphic designer Milton Glaser dives deep into a new painting inspired by Piero della Francesca. From here, he muses on what makes a convincing poster, by breaking down an idea and making it new.
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity, because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind.
You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.
I was asked, I guess about six years ago, to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature --
that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
And that was enormously liberating to me. Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation, but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero, in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro," who faces his consort, Battista.
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject, I did the following series of drawings.
That's the real Piero della Francesca --
one of the greatest portraits in human history.
And these, I'll just show these without comment. It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro, who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance, and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile.
And this is Battista.
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --
so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
Whoops! Passed each other.
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero, this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
And now, four large panels:
this is upper left;
upper right; lower left;
lower right.
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism. Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
On another subject -- -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.'
But everybody says they're reliable.
But, reliable Dutchman" -- -- "Fantastic!"
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman, you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike, preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this, all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
Or even "French."
Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.
I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach, and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."
And so he did.
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
I could make nothing of that.
And I really struggled with this one.
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea, was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big, and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow, and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.
So I took another crack at it -- you've got to keep it moving --
and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board. I thought that something would come out of it, like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope" because it's by Alexander Pope, but I sort of made a mess out of it, and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
So, it was going nowhere.
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem, I write down things that I know about it.
But you can see the beginning of an idea there, because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
That's what happens.
There's a relationship between the old and the new;
the new emerges from the context of the old.
And then I did some variations of it, but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N, even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it.
Then I got the words "new" and "old" and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
I was really desperate at this point.
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of, which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together. It says "dreams" at the top.
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
But, to my credit, I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch.
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting, but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be, which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- "If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations. This one generates no imagery at all."
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
Which is something you never want to do professionally.
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
What's the heart of this poem?
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old, like this."
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
Well, I found a way to use it.
So, there's that little alternative over there, and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself -- "but more didactic than visual.
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace, a kind of dance where each defines the other."
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
There's a significant difference.
This could be embarrassing.
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience, and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
And as you know, you have to have a front.
I mean -- you've got to be confident;
if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
So that's one thing, to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
That can be a big contribution.
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;
you get the big one and if you don't like that, how about the little one?
And that too is a relatively new idea.
And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?
Now, this is a little illusion.
That poster is not folded.
It's not folded, that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
But, we don't have time.
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective, where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective, but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally.
And another piece for the art directors' club is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it, and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I worked very hard on this. The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster, all of which had a different idea of what art is.
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is" and trying to determine what art was.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And as soon as I said that, I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever," and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster, in case you don't get it.
Now this says, "Note to the viewer: I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation, surrealism has become banal, a shadow of its former self.
The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,' hidden in the word 'whatever.'
The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined: as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing, and the shape of the thing.
Whatever."
OK. And the one that I did not submit, which I still like,
I wanted to use the same phrase. There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.
And that idea stuck in my head.
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
But what really happens is that you read it as: "Art is whatever remains."
Thank you.
Laurie Santos looks for the roots of human irrationality by watching the way our primate relatives make decisions. A clever series of experiments in "monkeynomics" shows that some of the silly choices we make, monkeys make too.
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species.
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious, and that's that our species, Homo sapiens, is actually really, really smart -- like, ridiculously smart -- like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now.
And this is, of course, not the first time you've probably recognized this.
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral.
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more, and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart, we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes.
But of course, just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face.
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think, don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make, which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us, when put in certain contexts, will actually make very specific mistakes.
The errors we make are actually predictable.
We make them again and again.
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
When we get negative feedback, we still, the next time we're face with a certain context, tend to make the same errors.
And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature.
What I'm most curious about is, how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time?
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
Because we're a smart species, we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super, super complicated, sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand, even though we've actually created them.
We create financial markets that are super complex.
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it, in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up.
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error.
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with, the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those, design things better, and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be.
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying, which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again.
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways.
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about, because, if it's us that's messed up, it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it.
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
What we need is a population that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions, but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have, any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology, human culture, maybe even not human language.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
These guys are New World primates, which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago.
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great -- with about five million "greats" in there -- grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great
grandmother with five million "greats" in there as Holly up here.
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant, but albeit evolutionary, relative.
The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well, but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
So she's the perfect test case.
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?
Does she make the same mistakes as us?
Does she not learn from them? And so on.
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up.
First problem is just, well, where should we start?
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse, around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,
we said, hhmm, maybe we should actually start in the financial domain.
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that, maybe you guys don't know, but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it?
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money.
So that's just what we did.
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency.
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token.
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans, to actually buy different pieces of food.
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much. Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know, once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it.
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures, they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
They were these kind of weird things.
But very quickly, the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food.
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn't know.
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter, and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
Hands it over, and then gets some food.
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman.
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food.
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
So the monkeys get really good at this.
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
The question is: is this anything like human money?
Is this a market at all, or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something, looking smart, but not really being smart.
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
Well, you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
You might have them start paying attention to price, paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
Do the monkeys do anything like this?
And so our monkey marketplace was born.
The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
When they get a hankering for some treats, we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
Upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market, a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from.
The salesmen were students from my lab.
They dressed differently; they were different people.
And over time, they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn, you know, who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish. and that's what the monkey can for a single token.
So everything costs one token, but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others, sometimes more grapes than others.
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
But here's Honey.
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
You can see Honey, very good market economist, goes with the guy who gives more.
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
So not just Honey, most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools, they basically matched, not just qualitatively, but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market.
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers, you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that, at least for the monkeys and us, works like a real financial currency.
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species.
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else.
The other thing we also spontaneously saw, embarrassingly enough, is spontaneous evidence of larceny.
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other, often from us -- you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing, but things we spontaneously saw.
So we said, this looks bad.
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out, you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit.
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges, or certain kinds of economic experiments.
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself, I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Take these, put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
Donate it, take it, and so on.
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
And here's your choice: you can either be risky, in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
So see what your intuition is here.
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
People are a little risk-averse. So what?
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently.
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
And now imagine that I have you make another choice
But this time, it's a little bit worse.
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money, but you're going to get the same choice.
You can either take a risky loss -- so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this, which is when presented with these options, people don't choose to play it safe.
They actually tend to go a little risky.
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice.
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with.
So what's going on?
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500.
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another.
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
This is all well and good, except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not.
And this leads to the second bias, which economists have called loss aversion.
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this.
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
That means when we're in a risk mindset -- excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset, we actually become more risky, which can actually be really worrying.
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms.
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they don't want to sell at a loss.
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases.
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market, would they do the same thing as people?
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time.
And then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more, or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
And so this is what this looks like.
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape, so it looks pretty good.
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.
For a big bonus, now they get three.
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial, or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky, but big, bonus, but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
People here played it safe.
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
Qualitatively and quantitatively, they choose exactly the same way as people, when tested in the same thing.
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.
And so we ran a second version of this.
Now, the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses; they're actually giving them less than they expect.
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two.
the guy on the right is the risky loss.
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched, but sometimes he actually gives a big loss, taking away two to give the monkeys only one.
And so what do the monkeys do?
Again, same choice; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time, or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice, they do the same irrational thing that people do.
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started.
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
So what does all of this mean?
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it.
They do some of the smart things we do, some of the kind of not so nice things we do, like steal it and so on.
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.
They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do.
This is the first take-home message of the Talk, which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought, oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know -- Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have.
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
A little bad for monkey investors.
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.
Because we've answered the question we started out with.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions, tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
In fact, they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history.
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey.
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results, means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old.
That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.
What do we know about other old strategies like this?
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
You can't just shut that off.
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
We're just built differently.
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions.
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red, when you're watching your house price go down, you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms.
This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly, that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome.
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
Well, the good news, I think, is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk, which is that humans are not only smart; we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know, I flew over here in an airplane.
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
And here's the rub.
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is."
But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them.
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations, not necessarily as unovercomable, but to recognize them, accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be.
Thank you.
Accepting his 2005 TED Prize, photographer Edward Burtynsky makes a wish: that his images -- stunning landscapes that document humanity's impact on the world -- help persuade millions to join a global conversation on sustainability.
Walk around for four months with three wishes, and all the ideas will start to percolate up.
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us.
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something, or come up with something, that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian. We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population, and my father was an avid outdoorsman.
So I really had a chance to experience that.
And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening,
and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way.
And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did.
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside.
This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape.
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there, that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture, or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed.
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania, and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway. And I ended up in a town called Frackville.
I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
Totally transformed by man.
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this, and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find.
And that became the baseline of what I was doing. And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto, and not have to re-invent myself --
that this theme was large enough to become a life's work, to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are.
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks, which I kind of missed, was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs -- to get into that place to make those photographs,
and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations, I would have never made this body of work.
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
I own a corporation. I work with them, and I feel that we all need them and they're important.
But I am also for sustainability.
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.
And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here, but it is a slow progression.
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
And these ages of man are still at work today. But we've become totally disconnected from them.
There's something that we're not seeing there.
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles, and what we're doing to that landscape -- that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
And through my photographs, I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work, and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it --
to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level,
but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there, and it gets people to look at these things, and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too --
that I'm drawn to have a good life. I want a house, and I want a car. But there's this consequence out there.
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it, and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
That in the recycling work that I was doing, I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence, back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.
Of course, listening at the conference, there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry, and there's many other things that are coming on stream -- nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart.
And we all look forward to those things.
But in the meantime, these things are scaling up. These things are continuing to happen.
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh, so I started to move away from North America;
I started to look at our world globally.
These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to.
They were talking about Exxon Valdez, and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries.
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned, and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand, literally, in third-world countries.
So originally I was going to go to India.
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there, and then I was able to get into Bangladesh,
and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it, that I had never actually thought was possible.
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense, and the working conditions were horrible.
Here you're looking at some oil fields in California, some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil.
And that, to me, was again something that I started building on, and I continued to build on.
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years, under the heading of "The Oil Party."
Because I think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.
I'm going to move to some pictures of China.
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago, and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,
not to mention that China, as well, has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
I came out of a blue-collar town, a GM town, and my father worked at GM,
so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know, to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam, and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said, "It's just too big."
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago, they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
It took fifteen days to fill it. So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long, one of the largest reservoirs ever created.
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir, and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
This is a "before and after." So that was before.
And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite, everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
And this gives you an idea.
And it was all the people who lived in those homes, were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
And these are some of the images from that.
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam, looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now, there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years because of the "NIMBY" problem -- "Not In My BackYard."
But in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly.
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;
some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated, depending on whose statistics you're looking at.
And this is what they were building. This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.
This is the town hall for the city.
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess, what we know here, in terms of urban planning.
There were no parks; there were no green spaces.
Very high-density living on the side of a hill.
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up, but somehow were not connecting with them.
Here is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.
Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."
So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture.
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace, and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
And there's about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times,
and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
The manufacturers are -- the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms.
So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
And they have dorms for the workers.
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
This is a shift change, one of three. There's two factories of this scale in the same town.
This is one with 45,000, so every lunch, there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai -- I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai, and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
What's also happening in Shanghai is -- China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.
They won't move. They're not negotiating.
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal.
They're being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years, or maybe even thousands of years, are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think, ever attempted on the planet.
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with -- again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something, and these are called the villas.
And also, like right now, they're just moving.
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area, and if you looked in the foreground on the big print, you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.
So the industry's already growing around these new developments.
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced.
In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people, and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
There's 9,000 of them here, and they're being built for most of the big cities, Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
And what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
And the density is quite incredible.
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings, I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air-conditioning system;
every window has an air conditioner in it.
And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies, but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
And when you start looking at that, and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai, it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
And you can see in the foreground of this picture, it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
Most recently I went in, and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China.
And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers, five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
10 hours a day at this speed.
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China, is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers, and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes, and picked this one woman.
And it was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable.
But that is the trick that they've got right now, that they're winning with, is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines, and bringing all the components into play, but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw; this is a shot of it.
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
They were just wound up doing these things all day long, until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say, "Okay, everybody freeze."
It wasn't too bad, but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.
And what you're seeing here is, again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills. There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.
The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
And I started getting in further and further into the factories.
And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places.
This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together, pre-going into the textile mills.
Here's something that's far more labor-intensive, which is the making of shoes.
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
The company itself had about 10,000 employees, and they're doing domestic shoes.
It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas, and that's very hard to get.
And they don't want to let me in.
But the domestic was much easier to do.
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where, really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone, one of the largest mobile makers in China.
I think mobile phone companies are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis, and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
This is a textile where they're doing shirts --
Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
Everything is very efficient.
While setting up this shot, people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers --
they make 20 million of them in the world.
There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long.
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken.
So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there.
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships.
That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures, where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel from electrical motors out, and recycling them.
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
But this is what happens to most of the computers.
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
It's referred to as "e-waste" there.
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes, which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards, and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards, you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries, so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches, in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,
if there's a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it, but they can't stop the product from coming in.
This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits, but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao, and she's been through the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
And to me the whole notion -- the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect.
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate, and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes, is sitting with these thoughts in mind, and thinking about, "How is their life going to be when they want to have children, or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever, 15 years from now?"
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking -- in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind, hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one, I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
And it just started about 14 months ago. And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
What they're doing there is that they're not -- I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much; it's used the apocalyptic tone too much;
it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out. Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements, about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices, and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability.
And so for me, one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website.
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;
these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com, can be placed into any kind of media. They could be posted through the Web; they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
So we're looking at this as trying to build out.
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text, and the text is blasted all over.
What was unusual, according to Stephen, is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, "Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog, and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death.
This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out, and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India, in China, in South America -- there's entries coming from all around the world.
I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
And one of the things that came out -- Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
And you think about it, you know, grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason, so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
So it's this great window where they actually are -- you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is, and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize, so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings, and the rest is going to be to manage this project,
but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these -- call them "prize targets."
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-school project, the best one for a household project, or it could be the best community project for sustainability.
And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen -- it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things -- whether it's equipment, like a media lab, or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools, or schools that are with kids that age, and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them.
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
In that way, what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into, I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way, and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now, but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things, and the energy footprint, and how that matters.
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And again, in "In My World," the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
And I like the words, "in my world," because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;
I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project, and do something for schools.
I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash -- it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."
And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself, and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, "There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance.
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday. I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now -- I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that, and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.
Less than 10% of plastic trash is recycled -- compared to almost 90% of metals -- because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds. Frustrated by this waste, Mike Biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can, and does, recycle any kind of plastic.
I'm a garbage man.
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man, because I absolutely hate waste.
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life.
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.
Think back when you were just a kid.
How did look at the stuff in your life?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules: It's my stuff if I saw it first.
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
The more stuff that's mine, the better.
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry, it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff.
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent.
In fact, the United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth, that number well more than doubles.
And of course, the more developed the country, the bigger these mountains.
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage.
We see above-ground mines.
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams.
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff.
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day?
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world.
And the plastics, we get from oil, which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner.
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff, if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals. To put that in perspective -- and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals, because it's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler, probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered.
In fact, it's more like five percent.
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material, have very little value.
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel.
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material?
Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another.
They have very different densities.
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.
And they even have different colors.
So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials.
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties.
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know.
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics.
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover, which is, again, mostly the plastics.
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here.
And they extract the metals by hand.
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution, this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution.
I call this environmental arbitrage.
And it's not fair, it's not safe and it's not sustainable.
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way, those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics.
This is just one example.
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
They store the plastics on the roofs.
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these, and people try very hard to separate the plastics, by color, by shape, by feel, by any technique they can.
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic.
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way.
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home.
So what are we to do about this space-age material, at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke.
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around, trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other, and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends, in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world, and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.
And we eventually broke the code.
This is the last frontier of recycling.
It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.
And we finally figured out how to do it. And in the process, we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics.
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals.
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways, to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint, sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
Well a good place to start is with waste.
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil, and it's plentiful,
as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them, we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment.
We have enormous energy savings.
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way.
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life, our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings.
They get to close the loop with their products.
And they get to make more sustainable products.
In the short time period I have, I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.
They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials, but predominantly plastics.
We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it.
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets, we're using air classification.
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite: many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics.
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process, and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics, not only by type, but by grade.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
We push that material to extruders where we melt it, push it through small die holes, make spaghetti-like plastic strands.
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets.
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.
This is the same material that you would get from oil.
And today, we're producing it from your old stuff, and it's going right back into your new stuff.
So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home.
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products.
So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life.
We took our clues from mother nature.
Mother nature wastes very little, reuses practically everything.
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time.
And finally, I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff." Thank you for your time.
Join Rev. James Forbes at the dinner table of his Southern childhood, where his mother and father taught him what compassion really means day to day -- sharing with those who need love.
Compassion:
what does it look like?
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled --
at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
Before we could eat, she would ask, "Are all the children in?"
And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.
Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored, all are honored.
Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in.
My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
Why? Because they were old and infirm,
and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.
They are our family."
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
They would offer sweets or money.
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, 'Nothing.' And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'" This was the nature of being at that table.
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy."
So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it.
And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in?
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate.
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
We thought he must be out of his mind.
This is our time. This is intimate time.
This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
And mom overheard us and said, "Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
That's what the celebration is all about.
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
So, we sucked up.
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together.
We are sisters and brothers united together.
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
We're all strands in it.
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
Now that's compassion.
So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma.
Just a photograph.
Arm in arm for struggle.
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset.
You heard about riots all across the land.
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
This is the picture. They said, "It's going to be too volatile for you to go."
He insisted, "I must go."
So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, "I have bad news for you.
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But," he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.
I know how you feel."
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule:
"As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message.
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:
9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, "That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city.
It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.
We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them.
'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.'
And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher.
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too.
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, "Some people preach the Gospel.
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
How do you make it real?
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it.
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness.
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, "You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself."
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'"
And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."
And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that, 'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.
I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God's children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health, are all the children in?" And we could say yes.
Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going.
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say, and to be a good American -- for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity.
We are one people together.
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor.
This is a season of grace.
Unusual things are beginning to happen.
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal.
Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse.
And so I want to close with a little song.
I close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
And this is why we do it.
The song says, ♫ "I made heaven so happy today, ♫ ♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫ That's compassion.
For five years, young Emmanuel Jal fought as a child soldier in the Sudan. Rescued by an aid worker, he's become an international hip-hop star and an activist for kids in war zones. In words and lyrics, he tells the story of his amazing life.
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.
And I come from a long way.
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book.
And also telling it like now.
And also, the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music.
So I have branded myself as a war child.
I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now, who have lost her children.
There is no newspaper to cover her pain, and what she wants to change in this society.
And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write. Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, for them to talk.
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story,
this painful stories out, the dreams I have,
sometimes, is like the voices of the dead, that I have seen would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it, because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.
Well I was born in the most difficult time, when my country was at war.
I saw my village burned down. The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it vanish in my face.
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.
My mother was claimed by the war.
My brothers and sisters were scattered.
And up to now, me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him.
Seeing people die every day, my mother crying,
it's like I was raised in a violence.
And that made me call myself a war child.
And not only that, when I was eight I became a child soldier.
I didn't know what was the war for.
But one thing I knew
was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.
When I went to the training camp I say, "I want to kill as many Muslims, and as many Arabs, as possible."
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force, because I wanted to revenge for my family. I wanted to revenge for my village.
Luckily now things have changed
because I came to discover the truth.
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims, wasn't the Arabs.
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,
which is the oil, the diamond, the gold and the land.
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose: should I continue to hate, or let it go?
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them.
I even had a movie out called "War Child," funded by Muslim people.
So that pain has gone out.
But my story is huge.
So I'm just going to go into a different step now,
which is easier for me.
I'm going to give you poem called "Forced to Sin,"
which is from my album "War Child."
I talk about my story. One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food
and we were like around 400.
And only 16 people survived that journey.
So I hope you're going to hear this.
My dreams are like torment. My every moment. Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.
Friends like Lual who died by my side, of starvation.
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain. Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry. As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade,
he gave me comfort.
We used to raid villages, stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,
anything we could eat.
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.
And therefore I was forced to sin, forced to sin to make a living,
forced to sin to make a living.
Sometimes you gotta lose to win.
Never give up. Never give in.
Left home at the age of seven. One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side. Slept with one eye open wide.
Run, duck, play dead and hide.
I've seen my people die like flies.
But I've never seen a dead body, at least one that I've killed.
But still as I wonder, I won't go under.
Guns barking like lightning and thunder.
As a child so young and tender, Words I can't forget I still remember.
I saw sergeant command raising his hand, no retreat, no surrender.
I carry the banner of the trauma.
War child, child without a mama, still fighting in the saga.
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.
No sit or stop, as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.
I'm on a fight, day and night.
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.
It's like I'm living a dream.
First time I'm feeling like a human being.
Ah! The children of Darfur.
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for.
Left home.
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.
My country is war-torn.
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.
Ask God question, what am I here for. And why are my people poor. And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write, I was learning how to fight. I ate snails, vultures, rabbits, snakes, and anything that had life. I was ready to eat.
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?
Thank you.
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.
I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy.
So the music had been my therapy for me.
It's been where I actually see heaven,
where I can be happy, where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.
So one thing I know about music:
music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system, your mind, your heart, influence your soul and your spirit,
and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing.
Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg, without even wanting to do it.
And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love
when love doesn't see a color.
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.
One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when
I was still a soldier back then. I hated the people in the north.
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.
So we party and dance to their music.
And one thing that shocked me is one day
they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers. And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.
But I had this question.
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.
So what's happening here?
I've been in a painful journey.
Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner.
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.
And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win. Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now.
So my breakfast, my lunch, I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan.
And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.
So in my village now, kids there, they normally listen to BBC, or any radio, and they are waiting to know, the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast
it means he got the money to build our school.
And so I made a commitment. I say, "I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled. So it's taken me 232 days.
And I said, "No stop until we get it."
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.
The people are giving three dollars.
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.
Somebody donated 20 cents online. I don't know how they did it.
But that moved me.
And so, the importance of education to me
is what I'm willing to die for.
because I know what it can do to my people.
Education enlighten your brain, give you so many chances, and you're able to survive.
As a nation we have been crippled.
For so many years we have fed on aid.
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old families in a refugee camps.
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.
So these people, you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.
If anybody want to help us this is what we need.
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.
Invest in education.
Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything.
Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.
But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa.
That's what I'm asking.
So in order to do that, I founded a charter called Gua Africa,
where we put kids in school.
And now we have a couple in university.
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice." And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.
That's what I want to do to change, to make a difference in the world.
Well now, my time is going, so I want to sing a song.
But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune
that made it possible for me to be here.
I'm gonna sing this song, just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.
She came to my country and saw the importance of education.
She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women, educating them, educating the children,
so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society.
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA.
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.
One of them happened to be me now.
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?
Audience: Yes!
Emmanuel Jal: All right.

Go save a life of a child.
Statistician Nic Marks asks why we measure a nation's success by its productivity -- instead of by the happiness and well-being of its people. He introduces the Happy Planet Index, which tracks national well-being against resource use . Which countries rank highest in the HPI? You might be surprised.
Martin Luther King did not say, "I have a nightmare," when he inspired the civil rights movements.
He said, "I have a dream."
And I have a dream. I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking, but everything is desolate, everything is dead.
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road.
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future.
For too long, we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen.
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.
We have focused on the problems.
And we have not thought enough about the solutions.
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer.
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away.
And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change.
People are freezing and running away because we're using fear.
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is.
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?
And one of the problems that we face, I think, is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is, an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow, if we get the right numbers to go up, we're going to be better off, whether that's on the stock market, whether that's with GDP and economic growth, that somehow life is going to get better.
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better.
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations.
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system, Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s, said that, "A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income."
But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff.
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce.
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been.
And he finished his talk with the phrase, that, "The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile."
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress, our dominant measure of progress in society, is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile?
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today, he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile.
He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice, sustainability and people's well-being.
And actually, social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world.
This is from a global survey.
It's asking people, what do they want.
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world say that what they want is happiness, for themselves, for their families, their children, their communities.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness, and it's not nearly as important as love.
We all need to love and be loved in life.
It's not nearly as important as health.
We want to be healthy and live a full life.
These seem to be natural human aspirations.
Why are statisticians not measuring these?
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms, instead of just how much stuff we have?
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness, how do we measure well-being, how can we do that within environmental limits.
And we created, at the organization that I work for, the New Economics Foundation, something we call the Happy Planet Index, because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
And what we do, is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet.
But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It is the ultimate scarce resource, the one planet that we share.
And economics is very interested in scarcity.
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome, it thinks in terms of efficiency. It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use.
It is an efficiency measure.
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph.
Running horizontally along the graph, is "ecological footprint," which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet.
More is bad.
Running vertically upwards, is a measure called "happy life years." It's about the well-being of nations.
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average.
To the top right of the graph, are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being, but they're using a lot of planet to get there.
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually.
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph, are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically, sub-Saharan Africa.
In Hobbesian terms, life is short and brutish there.
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years.
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world.
But now for the good news!
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles, that are doing better than global average, that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
This is an aspirational graph.
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
They're Latin American.
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to.
Maybe some of you have.
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
That is longer than in the USA.
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll, the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
They are the happiest place.
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources.
What's going on there?
What's happening in Costa Rica?
We can look at some of the data.
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021.
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949.
And they invested in social programs -- health and education.
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world.
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
They have the social connectedness.
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European.
It might be Latin American.
And the challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here.
That's what we need to do.
And if we're going to do that, we need to pull countries from the bottom, and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world, but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
And this is the trend in well-being over that time, a small increase, but this is the trend in ecological footprint.
And so in strict happy-planet methodology, we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to.
And the point really is, is that I think, probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening.
It's actually not very long away.
It's half a human lifetime away.
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050.
This is not the very distant future.
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
That is changing our business.
That is changing the way we create our organizations, we do our government policy and we live our lives.
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being.
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce.
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop.
I think we want it to carry on.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
They want to hold on to what they've got.
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do.
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that, but the point is we need to turn those curves.
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory, systems engineers, where they create feedback loops, put the right information at the right point of time.
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."
You put a smart meter in your home, and you see how much electricity you're using right now, how much it's costing you, your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
What would that look like for society?
Why is it, on the radio news every evening, I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio -- I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
And why do I hear that?
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday?
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions?
That's how you create a collective goal.
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being
At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.
What are these for happiness?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier?
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago, a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome.
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life?
And the point of these is they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness, but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life.
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy?
Keep building them.
The second one is be active.
The fastest way out of a bad mood: step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
Being active is great for our positive mood.
The third one is take notice.
How aware are you of things going on around the world, the seasons changing, people around you?
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being.
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course.
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
It's more curiosity.
It can be learning to cook a new dish, picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
Keep learning.
And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities, but give.
Our generosity, our altruism, our compassion, are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain.
We feel good if we give.
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people.
You measure their happiness at the end of the day, those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves.
And these five ways, which we put onto these handy postcards, I would say, don't have to cost the earth.
They don't have any carbon content.
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth.
Now, Martin Luther King, on the eve of his death, gave an incredible speech.
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead, there may be trouble ahead, but I fear no one. I don't care.
I have been to the mountain top, and I have seen the Promised Land."
Now, he was a preacher, but I believe the environmental movement and, in fact, the business community, government, needs to go to the top of the mountain top, and it needs to look out, and it needs to see the Promised Land, or the land of promise, and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want.
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition to get there, and we need to pave that great transition with good things.
Human beings want to be happy.
Pave them with the five ways.
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index. And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want, where happiness does not cost the earth.
Julia Sweeney <em></em> performs the first 15 minutes of her 2006 solo show <em>Letting Go of God.</em> When two young Mormon missionaries knock on her door one day, it touches off a quest to completely rethink her own beliefs.
On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, "Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes. But, more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil, and anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason." So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
And my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
So, you've grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record."
And I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it." And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
All that being good and no real credit for it.
And, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?" So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her.
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious.
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information.
They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man." And Bill said, "So?" And then I said, "So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it." And he said, "So?" And I said, "So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus." Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, "I need to speak to you privately.
September 10 is not your birthday. It's October 10." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15." "So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready." I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
Which was comforting, but troubling.
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends, what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom, and I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.
And this meant that I was a Libra?
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.
But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
Oh, life can be so cruel.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door.
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.
So, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.
And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
and they said they had a message for me from God.
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them,
but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water -- OK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair.
OK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but, you know, I don't like that word, heart, because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God." But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said "Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."
And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, "Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
And I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here." And God did lead them.
He led them to America.
I said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil --
every single one of them just bad to the bone.
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S." And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.
I wanted to say, "OK, don't start with this story." I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't."
Because I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by righteous?
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy."
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But, no, it wasn't any of these gifts.
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." And they said, "No."
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say.
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity." And I said, "Oh, dear -- -- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
And they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
I said, "Oh -- now, I don't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure." And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
Would God force you to get your old nose back?
Well, then they gave me this Book of Mormon, and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me,
and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry," or maybe it was just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby, and that's the son of God," I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.
I'm just so used to that story.
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now, if they'd asked me, Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, "Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see." But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
Renowned classical Indian dancer Ananda Shankar Jayant was diagnosed with cancer in 2008. She tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it, and gives a performance revealing the metaphor of strength that helped her do it.
[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance,
and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
Is this the end of my dance?"
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ... I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
But I needed something else.
I needed something to go that extra mile,
and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,
laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."
20 years ago, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. For his next project, he's building a web for open, linked data that could do for numbers what the Web did for words, pictures, video: unlock our data and reframe the way we use it together.
Time flies.
It's actually almost 20 years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information, the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
Now, 20 years on, at TED, I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side, as a sort of a play project, kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like: hypertext protocol, HTTP; the idea of URLs, these names for things which started with HTTP.
I wrote the code and put it out there.
Why did I do it?
Well, it was basically frustration.
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer in this huge, very exciting lab, lots of people coming from all over the world.
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
They had all sorts of different data formats,
all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.
So that, in all that diversity, if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this, everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine, I had to learn to run some new program, I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
And these were all incompatible.
It was just very frustrating.
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky, say on the Internet, then life would be so much easier.
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like.
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext, a page which has got links, and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.
Not impressive.
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
What was difficult was to get them to imagine:
so, imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine.
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
Well, some people did.
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
And that is what has made it most fun.
That has been the most exciting thing,
not the technology, not the things people have done with it, but actually the community, the spirit of all these people getting together, sending the emails.
That's what it was like then.
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --
I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
And you did.
Thanks.
It's been a blast, hasn't it?
I mean, it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away.
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little, initial website that we started off with.
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
There is still a huge frustration
that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?
Well, documents you read, OK?
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --
one of the great TED Talks.
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world.
He put up a slide a little bit like this.
It had underground all the data
OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,
and that's how we think of it, isn't it?
Because data you can't naturally use by itself
But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives
and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
In this case, Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
He had put it together, combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software, which I think his son developed, originally, and produces this wonderful presentation.
And Hans made a point of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web
and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web
and then calling that linked data. The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:
first thing is that those HTTP names -- those things that start with "http:" -- we're using them not just for documents now, we're using them for things that the documents are about.
We're using them for people, we're using them for places, we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web, I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event. Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person, where they were born, things like that.
So the second rule is I get important information back.
Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships.
Data is relationships.
Interestingly, data is relationships.
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP.
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in, and the population of it, and so on. So I can browse this stuff.
So that's it, really.
That is linked data.
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago and soon after that, things started to happen.
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had, and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.
It's not just a root supplying a plant,
but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data
and they get it connected together,
and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
So, linked data. The meme went out there.
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up, he noticed that Wikipedia -- you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it. Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.
And in most information boxes, there's data.
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia, and put it into a blob of linked data
on the web, which he called dbpedia.
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide
and if you actually go and look up Berlin, you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin, you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?
Let's think about data for a bit.
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important, there's scientific data, there's personal data, there's weather data, there's data about events, there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it, so that you also see how much unlocked potential.
Let's start with government data.
Barack Obama said in a speech, that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats.
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
That's important. Why is it important?
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,
but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments
Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
It's actual useful. It's got value. I can use it in my company. I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better by making this data available.
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it --
Hans calls it database hugging.
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it.
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --
yes, make a beautiful website,
who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
Make a beautiful website, but first give us the unadulterated data,
we want the data.
We want unadulterated data.
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
Can you say "raw"?
Audience: Raw.
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?
Audience: Data.
TBL: Can you say "now"?
Audience: Now!
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!
Audience: Raw data now!
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now --
curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,
understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,
understanding how the world works.
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head, they try to communicate those over the web.
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases, often sitting in their computers, and actually, currently not shared.
In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos,
because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask, I wouldn't ask -- they would.
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before.
You get 223,000 hits -- no results you can use.
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together -- 32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at.
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --
questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --
is really a complete sea change.
It's very very important.
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --
the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you.
But, that's not true.
In fact, data is about our lives.
You just -- you log on to your social networking site,
your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend." Bing! Relationship. Data.
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. "
Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.
Every time you do things on the social networking site, the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it -- and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
But, when you go to another linked data site -- and let's say this is one about travel, and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group," you can't get over the walls.
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --
tremendous frustration. The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites.
We need to do that with linked data.
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap
The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater, I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back. And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org, and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
I did that. Me!
I did that to the map. I just did that!
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit
and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs.
And that is what linked data is all about.
It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
That's how linked data works.
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it.
And we've practiced that.
So, linked data -- it's huge.
I've only told you a very small number of things
There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure,
and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together.
And when you connect data together, you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
You get this really huge power out of it.
So, we're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --
they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them.
OK, so it's called linked data.
I want you to make it. I want you to demand it. And I think it's an idea worth spreading.
Thanks.
Daniel Goleman, author of <em>Emotional Intelligence</em>, asks why we aren't more compassionate more of the time.
You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen: HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night. And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will, about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal. I'm a psychologist, but rest assured, I will not bring it to the scrotal.
There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes, and we don't other times.
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic.
Half of those students were given, as a topic, the parable of the Good Samaritan: the man who stopped the stranger in -- to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
Half were given random Bible topics.
Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon.
As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help? The more interesting question is: Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about.
And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives: that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction.
There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.
This studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact.
And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help.
That is to say, if we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.
There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons, that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering, we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
But then the question is: Why don't we?
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption, to noticing, to empathy and to compassion.
And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves, if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day, we don't really fully notice the other.
And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle.
I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave, and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought, boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva. Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped, and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy, to feeling good for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. And this woman says, "My brother is having trouble getting dates, so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table,
and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo, the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up. And this woman says, "My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself; he never asks about the woman." And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages -- because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said that when she was in the dating scene, she had a simple test she put people to. The test was: from the moment they got together, how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word "you" in it.
And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article. Now this is a -- it's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party.
Here at TED there are great opportunities.
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called "The Human Moment," about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person.
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.
I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror -- he wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein -- he was trained as a Chaucer scholar, but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit. At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard, decided to write a book about a serial killer. This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.
And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents, his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
So my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying.
For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall. But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy, feeling with the other person. They're controlled by different parts of the brain.
So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to, and that is: how could you have done it?
Didn't you feel any pity for your victims? These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims.
And the strangler says very matter-of-factly, "Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off."
And I think that that is very troubling,
and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
When we focus on ourselves in any activity, we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism.
Right now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out, the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use.
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room, but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt. And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance, that cotton is very resistant to textile dye; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater. And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com, Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this, in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
Right now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt over the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?
Well, I've been thinking. For one thing, there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store. You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous, you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous, you can go into -- today, go into any store, put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode, which will take you to a website.
They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.
That website could tell you things about that object.
In other words, at point of purchase, we might be able to make a compassionate choice.
There's a saying in the world of information science: ultimately everybody will know everything.
And the question is: will it make a difference?
Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times, it was in the '80s, I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York -- it was homeless people on the streets.
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where, when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
We don't notice and therefore we don't act.
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day, I went down -- I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people.
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened, I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy.
And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English, he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving, and he'd fainted from hunger.
Immediately someone went to get orange juice, someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.
This guy was back on his feet immediately.
But all it took was that simple act of noticing,
and so I'm optimistic.
Thank you very much.
Richard Branson talks to TED's Chris Anderson about the ups and the downs of his career, from his multibillionaire success to his multiple near-death experiences -- and reveals some of his motivations.
Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.
Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.
CA: Have you met anyone interesting?
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn, because I had an apology to make to her.
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big, massive, big wedding ring on my finger.
And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off.
So -- -- so apologies to Goldie.
CA: That's pretty good.
So, we're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here.
You've started one or two in your time.
So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --
I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.
And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?
RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions: you must not talk about your own business, and this, and now you ask me.
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage, since you asked the question.
CA: It depends what the answer is though.
RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company, you can really run any companies.
I mean, companies are all about finding the right people, inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people. And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on, you know, the status quo and trying to turn it upside down.
So I've seen life as one long learning process.
And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't, 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.
And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.
CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing, because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.
And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who, at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic, and his view was that you were trading, you know, the world's fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.
Why did you do that?
RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.
And I think if you start a business without financial backing, you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways. They were trying to put our airline out of business, and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.
And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless I chipped in a chip.
And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline, and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company, I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually, for that as well.
RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.
But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.
CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.
What does the brand stand for in your head?
RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality, that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --
CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?
RB: No, but I was going to move on this.
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.
As I say, we go in and shake up other industries, and I think, you know, we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market.
CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.
I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?
RB: We couldn't find any customers.
CA: I was actually also curious why -- I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.
I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?
Ain't virgin no longer, or something.
RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.
I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints, you know, you can deal with them.
But about three months after the launch of the condom company, I had a letter, a complaint, and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.
But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.
And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken, I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if I'd be godfather, which I became.
So, it all worked out well.
CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.
RB: I should have.
CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.
I mean, what are the numbers on this?
I mean, how big is the group overall?
How much -- what's the total revenue?
RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.
CA: And how many employees?
RB: About 55,000.
CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.
What was that? Was that real?
RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.
No, I mean, I think -- CA: But is that your hair?
RB: No.
CA: What was that one?
RB: Dropping in for tea.
CA: OK.
RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which -- CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we -- it was a TEDster event there, I think.
Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?
RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?
CA: I mean, it is a tough job.
When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here, it's very strange.
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but -- CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about -- RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola, and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy" and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but -- CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?
RB: Of course.
CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.
And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?
RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols' "God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.
But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.
CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?
RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.
Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.
But nowhere else anyway.
CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
RB: No. I suppose if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something, that might be worth using it.
CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.
RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.
CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to, and Virgin Galactic up in the air.
So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing. And then 24 months from now, people will be able to take a ride into space.
CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?
RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it: the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico. And basically, he's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye, so when you're in space, you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.
And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.
But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.
CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?
RB: Philippe is quite erratic, so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.
CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.
RB: Yeah? No, he is a --
CA: Well, some people found it wonderful, some people found it completely bizarre.
But, I personally found it wonderful.
RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ... CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.
Have you ever regretted that?
RB: Many times.
I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past. Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so -- and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.
So in those moments, you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --
CA: What was the closest you got to -- when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was, each one, actually, I think we came close.
And, I mean, first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before, so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream, and we weren't quite sure, when a balloon actually got into the jet stream, whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.
And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic, as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour, the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour, and it just took off.
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
And we were just crossing every finger, praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time, and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.
CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone, the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...
CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.
RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon, with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below, trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which -- and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.
But, anyway, we managed to survive it.
CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?
RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left, and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped, I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision.
And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again, looked down at those clouds again, climbed back into the capsule again.
And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.
I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me, it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds, and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.
And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- CA: What did you write to your family?
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that: just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which -- just in case anything had happened.
But fortunately, they never had to use it.
CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls, you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.
How much was the PR value part of this?
RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner, the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats, and crashing into the seas.
CA: They have a point, Richard.
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying, you know, come on, Richard, there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.
CA: To do all this, you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?
RB: Well, I won't contradict that.
CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?
RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.
I certainly would have failed IQ tests. And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.
And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.
As somebody who's dyslexic, you also have some quite bizarre situations.
I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know, I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe, but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.
And so the board meetings have been fascinating.
And so, it's like, good news or bad news?
And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.
CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?
RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having -- -- I've got it right.
CA: No, trust me, it's gross.
RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said, "Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram. Here's a net in the sea, and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.
And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net, everything else is eaten."
And I finally worked it all out.
CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being, you know, doing pretty miserably academically, but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams. So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader, but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...
RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was, yeah, I was fortunately good at sport, and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.
CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.
I mean, there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."
Did this really happen?
RB: She was, you know, she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.
So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for, such as pushing us out of the car, and telling us to find our own way to Granny's, about five miles before we actually got there.
And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.
And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.
CA: But is there a risk here?
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids, and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.
Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they're too coddled, they don't know what they've got, we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids, you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.
So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ... Your headmaster said to you -- I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school -- he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison, and I'm not sure which.
Which of those happened first?
RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.
On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which -- we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.
And there's an ancient law that says you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.
So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.
We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots, but nobody came with VD any more.
So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.
And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols," the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.
And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.
And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.
And so I rang up Nottingham University, and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.
It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."
And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."
And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"
And he said he'd be delighted. And I said -- and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"
And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."
CA: That's great.
RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually "Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."
And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ... CA: That is outrageous.
So seriously, is there a dark side?
A lot of people would say there's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back, you know, doing some ugly things.
You've been accused of being ruthless.
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.
Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?
RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top, generally speaking, works.
I think if you treat people well, people will come back and come back for more.
And I think all you have in life is your reputation and it's a very small world.
And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well, and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.
CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending -- you keep getting caught up in these new projects, but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.
You get excited by an idea and, kapow!
I mean, do you think about life balance?
How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new?
RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important, so from the time the kids were very young, you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.
Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky, we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can -- so I can take them there and we can bring friends, and we can play together, but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.
CA: You started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy.
What is that?
RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.
You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people, and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.
And I think it's important that the individuals, who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars, but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world.
CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about, want to turn your resources toward?
RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into, A, trying to come up with alternative fuels and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels, in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point. We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.
And we just -- you know, there weren't really people working on that before, so we wanted people to try to -- all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that, and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth's atmosphere as well.
And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go.
And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.
CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?
RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called the war room, which is maybe the wrong word. We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa, all the different social problems in Africa, and try to look at best practices.
So, for instance, there's a doctor in Africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant, that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.
And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important.
CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea, getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world.
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say, we've got to fix this problem and we can do it, I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da -- here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?
RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually -- we're working with the government on it.
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think, of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him, it's a way of working with him, with his government.
It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help, they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.
It's got to be consistent.
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently.
For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment and free malaria treatment.
But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics, so that people pay for some other aspects.
CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates, or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image, for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.
What would you say to them?
RB: Well, I think that everybody -- people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed, I will want to feel that I've made a difference to other people's lives.
And that may be a selfish thing to think, but it's the way I've been brought up.
I think if I'm in a position to radically change other people's lives for the better, I should do so.
CA: How old are you?
RB: I'm 56.
CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment. 50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy.
I mean, it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases, you're still doing these incredible new plans.
How much do you think about legacy, and what would you like your legacy to be?
RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101, so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.
No, I just want to live life to its full.
You know, if I can make a difference, I hope to be able to make a difference.
And I think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance, who are good friends.
And, thank God, you've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world, it would be very worrying.
And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.
And I think it's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference.
CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business, I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of -- I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.
And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought, well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration, and for coming to TED today. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Alwar Balasubramaniam's sculpture plays with time, shape, shadow, perspective: four tricky sensations that can reveal -- or conceal -- what's really out there. At TEDIndia, the artist shows slides of his extraordinary installations.
The moment I say "school," so many memories come back to me.
It's like after every exam, when I walk out, the teacher would say, "Hey, come.
How did you do?"
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
And I didn't understand why, in one hand they say, "Speak the truth," in the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
So it went on like that, and I didn't know where else to find myself.
So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from [the] Unknown because, for some reason, I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god, because my friend's family had something else as a god.
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown and ask help," and started getting help from everywhere, each and every corner of my life at that time.
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
Then, when I was in eighth standard around 13 years old, I started working in a part-time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu.
And then school also started supporting me.
"Oh, he's bad at studies, but let him send to the drawing competitions."
So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school.
And one of those competitions, I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home.
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.
If you travel in Indian trains, you can see people listening to radio and, you know, even from their mobiles.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here.
You know, like just adjacent to me. He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
I think you should study in a school of art.
You just quit school and come there."
So, why I'm telling you this, you know, maybe, you know, whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible.
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
So that's what made me enter [the] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work, or art and finally I'm here in front of you.
When I look back, you know, on what happened between that time and now here -- the last 10/15 years -- I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects, but it was not intentional.
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking, "What really makes us?" -- you know, it's actually [the] past, what makes a person. So I was thinking, but when you look at the past, the way to understand the past is only by the traces available, because we cannot go back [to] the past.
It can be ruins, or it can be music, or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
And that fascinated me, to explore that territory.
So I was working on the line, but instead of working about traces, I started capturing traces.
So here are some of the works I would like to show you.
So this is called "Self In Progress."
It's just a trace of being in this body. So here, what happened then, you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself.
It's almost like a 3D photograph.
So there is an element of performance, and there is an element of sculpture, and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
So it's almost like fossils for the future.
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
So this is what I was talking about, while molding, it's such a great experience, because we have freedom of like walking, or moving my hand or, moving around in the space, but the moment this becomes solid, when you cannot move even an inch, because this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid; but after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because, knowingly or unknowingly, whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture thumbprint, footprint, or whatever traces we leave as humans."
This is the trace of fire,
this is the trace of sun.
Because when I was capturing traces, you know, this thought comes to me always: is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace, or is there other ways to capture it?"
So this work is nothing but like --
because of the focal length of the lens, it just shows what is on the other side.
So I just put the paper on the focal length, which was an etching print, then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
This is called "Dawn to Dawn." What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope, and just burnt it.
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
So wherever the fire is eating the paper, that's what becomes the work --
detail.
Even though we have traces when we try to understand them, the perception and context play a major role to understand it.
So do we really understand what it is, or are we trying to get what we think it is?
Then move towards questioning the perception because, even though there are traces, when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
So like let's say even a simple act.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
Can you just raise the hand?
If you just ask an opinion of how, everyone can interpret it.
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says, she'll simply say, "To get to the other side." Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
He would say, "For the greater good."
Martin Luther King would say, "I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road, without having their motives called into question."
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees the same cow walking around the street.
He would definitely say, "God came down from heaven, and he said unto the cow, 'Thou shalt cross the road.'
And cow crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow." Freud would say, "The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
If we ask Einstein, he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road, or the road moved underneath the cow, depends on your frame of reference."
Or Buddha -- if he saw the same cow, he would say, "Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
So, what we see is just what we think often, and most of the time, we don't see what it is.
It just all depends on one's perception.
And context, what is really context?
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
It's just created by the mind.
If you look at this piece of paper, this is the breadth and this is called length. This is how we've been taught in school.
But if you tear it in the middle --
now, I didn't touch this breadth, but still, the meaning of this changes.
So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there;
it's on the other side, even when we say dark, light, good, bad, tall, short -- all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
It's just that being a human, the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning.
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
It's just captured through from the lamp.
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
This is called "Limit Out."
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see?
This is an exact negative.
It's about six inches deep in the wall, but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
You know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin, and this is the second, and there's a third, and each creates a meaning.
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
Again, "Inward Out."
It's a full-figure cast from myself.
It's about eight inches deep.
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators -- and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception -- whenever I see the bird flying in the sky, it just makes me feel like: is there anything behind, are there any traces up there, which as a human, we don't see them?
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art?
I couldn't find it.
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months, in the restroom, when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor.
It's called Odonil.
This is the work I made out of that material.
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting, because I wrote to Balsara, who produces that air freshener called Odonil, saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"
They never wrote back to me.
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help."
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
They said, "Of course. This is the fee for the project report, and we will give you all the details," and they gave.
Finally, I went back to them and said, "It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
Please come for the show."
And they did.
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
In India, nobody really talks about works of art;
they always talk about the appreciation of art.
You buy this for 3,000 rupees, it'll become 30,000 in two months.
This is the craft that was going on, but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate.
And this was collected by Anapum -- which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything, because it will evaporate.
So this is after a few weeks,
this is after a few months.
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait," it may not be the portrait after a few months.
And if they say it's solid, it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
And if they say they don't get it, that's also not true, because it's in the air.
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
So they inhaled it, but they are not aware of it.
While I was doing that work, my mom and my dad, they were looking at it and they said, "Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
And I was like, "What do you mean?"
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said.
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking, "this is tucked in some small solid, but the moment it evaporates, it's merged with the whole."
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor?"
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.
Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together, or we can break the sculpture and get the dust, but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
So, I did this work for her.
It's called "Emerging Angel." This is the first day --
it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other.
So, the same sculpture after a few days.
This is after 15/20 days.
Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood, the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
This gave me a greater faith.
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [the] invisible.
So what you see now is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;
we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
The same thing in the darkroom.
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light, and we realize the existence of light.
So we don't see dark, we don't see light, we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
So, I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there.
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this, you know?
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
The skin of this is also representing this.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow.
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
Then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
So that produced a shadow.
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
Then, again, that becomes an object.
Again, throwing light, then the third one.
So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
You can see the detail.
This is called "Gravity." It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
It's a false wall, which contains like 110 cubic feet.
So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in.
So where it's happening, we can see, but what is happening will remain invisible only.
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
This is called "Kaayam."
Detail.
And what I'd like to tell you, our senses are so limited -- we cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
We don't feel, "I am touching the air," but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses.
So my recourse was like, is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign?
And to really get to the point, we should move beyond, you know, go to the other side of the wall, like in logic, like are invisible.
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint. But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it, you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints, and the footprints are nothing but passing time.
Thank you.
In this short, image-packed talk, Marisa Fick-Jordan talks about how a village of traditional Zulu wire weavers built a worldwide market for their dazzling work.
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
Thank you very much.
Physics and marketing don't seem to have much in common, but Dan Cobley is passionate about both. He brings these unlikely bedfellows together using Newton's second law, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the scientific method and the second law of thermodynamics to explain the fundamental theories of branding.
So I work in marketing, which I love, but my first passion was physics, a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher, when I had a little less gray hair.
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing.
So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university?
Who studied some physics in university?
Pretty good. And at school?
Okay, lots of you.
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
So, physics and marketing.
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law: "The force equals mass times acceleration." This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign.
But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction.
It's the same with brands:
the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more force is needed to change its positioning.
And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy.
It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners, and why companies like Unilever and P&G keep brands separate, like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand.
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction.
The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
Getting a little more technical now.
So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
The act of observation changes it.
It's the same in marketing.
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group, and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets, who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit, but don't shop like that any other day.
And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web, it's very few.
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
So luckily, the science -- no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,
you can only disprove it.
What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning, and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water.
So if we take an example -- Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth.
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water.
And there are parallels for marketing --
you can invest for a long time in a brand, but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief.
Take BP --
they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand, but then one little accident.
Think about Toyota.
It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident.
And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador.
Well, you know the story.
So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it --
any hypothesis is shaky.
And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work.
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand.
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics.
This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase.
The same is true of marketing.
If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand.
But where we are today, things have changed.
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster.
But then you lose control of it.
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes.
Your brand starts being dispersed,
it gets more chaotic.
It's out of your control.
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.
But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing.
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people.
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force, which is ultimately good for your brand.
So, the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
You can't fight it, so embrace it and find a way to work with it.
So to close, my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me that physics is cool, and hopefully, I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
Thank you.
Caroline Phillips cranks out tunes on a seldom-heard folk instrument: the hurdy-gurdy, a.k.a. the wheel fiddle. A searching, Basque melody follows her fun lesson on its unique anatomy and 1,000-year history.
Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French?
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle à roue." And in Spanish, "zanfona."
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay? Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music.
It has three different kinds of strings. The first string is the drone string, which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
And the third string is pretty innovative.
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound like a barking dog.
So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago
and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later. So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here.
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music -- in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy.
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.
And it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado, would you like to hear it?
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it?
CP: Okay.
There I go.
I'd like to sing in Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in France and Spain.
[Basque]
Thank you.
This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
Anthropologist Helen Fisher takes on a tricky topic -- love –- and explains its evolution, its biochemical foundations and its social importance. She closes with a warning about the potential disaster inherent in antidepressant abuse.
I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner.
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted;
and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
The first thing that happens is what I call --
a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
As a truck driver once said to me, he said, "The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently.
He said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."
And indeed, that's what we do.
And then you just focus on this person.
You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot --
their car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Chen: "I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me.
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.
You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy.
As one Polynesian said, he said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
You're up all night. You're walking till dawn.
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
Real dependence on this person.
As one businessman in New York said to me, he said, "Anything she liked, I liked."
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.
You become extremely sexually possessive.
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them.
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.
You'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.
The other main characteristic is motivation.
The motor in your brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
And last but not least, it is an obsession.
When I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.
But my most important question was always the same.
It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
And indeed, they would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."
And then, the very last question I would ask them --
I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I am not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
And my final question was always the same.
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
I was just staggered by it.
So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between.
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state.
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank you," you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.
People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love.
They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch," and indeed, that's what it is.
It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love.
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.
You know, you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
It can be focused on nobody.
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.
And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years,
that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
The first is women working, moving into the workforce.
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
And everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market --
and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education.
It's very slow.
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
Women are moving back into the job market.
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
The double income family was the standard.
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
Then, women's worst invention was the plow.
With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market.
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.
And it's going to have an impact.
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.
I'll only just say a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
There's a lot of gender differences;
anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
I don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike.
There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, "I think that we were built to be -- we're like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
And we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain.
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.
Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
Women can talk.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.
Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism.
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me, who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, "To have a great writer is to have another government."
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
They're highly imaginative.
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
They tend to be web thinkers.
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
We need both of them to get ahead.
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
When the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world.
When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed.
But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.
Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality.
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, "Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
And I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
"Oh, well -- men are more adulterous!"
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
And -- basic math!
Anyway.
In the Western world,
women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today.
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage," or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person.
People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry.
Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.
The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population.
They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85. Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
And I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.
It may decline some more.
I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women
-- women have never been as interesting as they are now.
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
However, there's always kinds of complications in this.
In these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together.
They can go together, by the way.
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.
With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment.
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.
So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
I think the happiness we find, we make.
And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.
So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.
The worry is about antidepressants.
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.
And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world.
I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, serotonin-enhancing -- SSRI, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13. I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something perfectly horrible. They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. I would recommend it.
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.
And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
Everybody knows that.
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
The things are connected in the brain.
And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another.
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
So now -- -- thank you.
I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment.
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike.
And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know? I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
They said, "Yes."
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
That's my current project; it will be my next book.
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
Timing is important. Proximity is important.
Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your "love map," an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.
And I also think that you
gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
And that's what I'm now contributing to this.
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too -- the magic of it.
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the --
probably a true story.
It was a graduate student at -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --
Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him.
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
So he decided he'd put science to work, and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she would fall in love with him.
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time.
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, "Wasn't that wonderful?"
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
There's magic to love!
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
Thank you.
Showing a series of inspiring, unusual and playful products, British branding and design guru Paul Bennett explains that design doesn't have to be about grand gestures, but can solve small, universal and overlooked problems.
Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country -- and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
And how do you bring those two things together?
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things. And that's what I want to talk about today.
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo.
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.
And I think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,
and all kinds of mappy stuff.
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
This is a minute 59.
3:19.
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
5:10.
5:58.
6:20.
We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --
this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was, for these guys, quite a revelation.
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
So they snapped into action.
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change. It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.
Very small example of something that they could do.
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,
but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
So you went from public space to private space.
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
I thought that was a really, really nice example.
So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.
It's a history of invention based around this.
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.
And he invented the shipping container. George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: "Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start."
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
Again, another medical example here.
We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
They'll ask the nurses to input data.
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.
And I think that's really, really important.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
Why do we all follow the line in the street?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
We don't know why, but we do.
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
This is people designing their own experiences.
You can draw from this.
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
It's there for our use, on some level.
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.
Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
Children live on things. They live under things.
They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is sitting under the table.
So, what came out of this?
This is the storage system that he designed.
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.
And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
And then use that information to fuel solutions?
And I think that's what this is very much about.
Last section: green armband. We've all got them. It's about this really.
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.
Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
They're now called KickStart.
And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
And that was completely irrelevant.
When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
These guys are using this very successfully.
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
We feel that this is an important gesture.
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
I hope you'll all wear them.
Architect Norman Foster discusses his own work to show how computers can help architects design buildings that are green, beautiful and "basically pollution-free." From the 2007 DLD Conference, Munich; www.dld-conference.com
As an architect you design for the present, with an awareness of the past, for a future which is essentially unknown.
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day.
And I'd like to share some experience
over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability.
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it, what are the threats, what are the possibilities, the challenges, the opportunities?
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago, before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda, that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is, that really, green is cool.
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life.
I rarely actually quote anything, so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can, [in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer, analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman, who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.
He said, "I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
We reached a tipping point this year where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political and competitive thing they could do.
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back, "When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"
And I think it was July 20, 1969, when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system, I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia.
And interestingly, as I think back, they were the first true environmentalists.
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion, fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.
And at that period it was -- in a way, a number of things were happening.
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru -- again, a word that had not been coined.
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
It's another subject. It's another conversation.
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
It was at that time, with an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet, that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.
And it's a number of projects.
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands.
And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook, and you had the hippie movement.
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing, which seeks to sum up the recommendations.
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance, in our vocabulary, you know, 30-odd years later:
wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells. And in parallel at that time, there was a very kind of exclusive design club.
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams, and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun.
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.
And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort, to amenities -- it was very, very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image, would be very, very stylishly packaged.
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.
And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here, finally connects with the physical world, there is the reality that that has become humanized, so that digital world has all the friendliness, all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here, as we generously had gifted at lunchtime, the [unclear], which is a further kind of development -- and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
A very, very beautiful object.
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.
And the reference to the iPod as iconic, and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --
quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007, the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle, which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves -- as architects, or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
Buildings are important, but they're only a component of a much bigger picture.
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate, if you could achieve the impossible, the equivalent of perpetual motion, you could design a carbon-free house, for example.
That would be the answer.
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.
It's only the beginning of the problem.
You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit.
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back and we look at planet Earth, and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society, then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry. But again, that only shows part of the picture.
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport, in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent, then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part.
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city, what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
The city goes out in annular rings, consuming more and more green space, and more and more roads, and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that, with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense, is only using one-tenth of the energy.
In other words, you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous.
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there, that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity, mass transit, the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance, the quality of civic spaces.
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top, extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city, is not dense compared with the really dense cities.
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more, which were occurring in the developing world.
And now, out of typically 46 cities, 33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of, for example, China or India.
If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening, 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world --
and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.
So, if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years, then that same process is happening in 20 years.
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period, we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy, over that period where the urbanization has trebled.
If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology?
How does it affect the design of buildings?
And particularly, how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution and are more socially responsible?
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber, in a small market town in the northeast of England, commuting distance with London.
And here, the first thing you can see is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden, which is also about the celebration of public space.
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature.
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime, it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
Now this was 1973.
In 2001, this building received an award.
And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time.
And the people who'd created it came back: the project managers, the company chairmen then.
And they were saying, you know, "The architects, Norman was always going on about designing for the future, and you know, it didn't seem to cost us any more.
So we humored him, we kept him happy."
The image at the top, what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you can wire this building.
This building was wired for change.
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology.
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed.
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
Round about that design period leading up to this building, I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time, and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level."
In other words, we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building.
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate, would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building, is very much a pioneering building.
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory.
The library of the Free University, which opened last year, is an example of that.
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality.
And a combination of devices here, the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks, and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin, which enables the building to be ventilated, to consume dramatically less energy, and where it's really working with the forces of nature.
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it.
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle, and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.
And you can measure the performance, in terms of energy consumption, of that building against a typical library.
If I show another aspect of that technology then, in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials, but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability, the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit, to transfer that information now, directly into the factory.
So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen, and those points in space are communicated.
And on the left are the cutting machines, which then, in the factory, enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very, very few millimeters, to be slotted together on site.
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
And again, the way in which that works as a building, for those of us who can enjoy the spaces, to live and visit there.
If I made the leap into these new technologies, then how did we -- what happened before that?
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone, the things that you take for granted?
Well, obviously the building still happened.
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here.
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air, and the many kilometers of cable and so on.
And the turning point was probably, in our terms, when we had the first computer.
And that was at the time that we sought to redesign, reinvent the airport.
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --
big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight, lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.
And Stansted, the green alternative, which uses natural light, is a friendly place: you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light -- electric light, which in turn creates more heat, which creates more cooling loads and so on.
And at that particular point in time, this was one of the few solitary computers.
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.
Not going back very far in time, 1990,
that's our office.
And if you looked very closely, you'd see that people were drawing with pencils, and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
I mean, major transformation.
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin, and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks, which record our archival information on past, current and future projects. That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
But meanwhile, as you know, wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature, set in the context of that,
interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory and very, very relevant to this place. Our Reichstag project, which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure, as a public place where we sought to, in a way, through a process of advocacy, reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians, public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto -- something that would be free, completely free of fuel as we know it.
So it would be totally renewable.
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,
but this very, very much a part of the ecology.
But here, not having to model it for real.
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place, but the ability now with the computer to explore, to plan, to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature:
natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below, and to look at biomass.
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil -- a process that, quite interestingly, was developed in Eastern Germany, at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc.
So really, retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.
You can measure it again.
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons --
what it would have been with natural gas
and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.
We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation, the way that you can model those gardens, the way they spiral around.
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
And again, we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption.
There is an evolution here between the projects, and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further --
the project in the city in London.
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting, is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site?
If, for example, you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement, it's the same amount of space.
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.
The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views, which give light, ventilation, make the building fresher.
And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance, which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again, in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller, and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity.
And here, if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria, the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces, we can see the high pressure, the low pressure, the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
So it also has the ability, all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind, to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
Comparing it with a typical building, what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking?
And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project.
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it.
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline, a pipe, sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried, that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea.
And our translation of that, using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline?
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are, of the Grand Canal, in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
In other words, water is the lifeblood.
And if you just go back to the previous image, and you look at this area of volatility and hostility, that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause, in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.
Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication.
And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world, then it's absolutely central to society.
And how do we make more legible in this growing world, especially in some of the places that I'm talking about -- China, for example, which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports.
Now what form do they take?
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age, because you always have a point of reference.
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society?
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building.
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
And the challenge here is a building that will be green, that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel, is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point, is very, very much about the lifestyle.
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces. As Hubert was talking over lunch, as we sort of engaged in conversation, talked about this, talked about cities.
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve, when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.
And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe, you know, the future was the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say, "We put a man on the moon."
You know, who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels, with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.
And that's a concerted platform.
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year, I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other, larger countries out there -- the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.
Thank you very much.
Kiran Bir Sethi shows how her groundbreaking Riverside School in India teaches kids life's most valuable lesson: "I can." Watch her students take local issues into their own hands, lead other young people, even educate their parents.
Contagious is a good word.
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
Inspiration is contagious.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the "I Can" bug.
So, the question is, why only them?
In a country of a billion people and some, why so few?
Is it luck? Is it chance?
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected?
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college,
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context, that if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of "aware," where they can see the change, "enable," be changed, and then "empower," lead the change.
And that directly increased student wellbeing.
Children became more competent, and less helpless.
But this was all common sense.
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside.
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey, and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world.
That's them rolling.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed.
And once that happened, they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished.
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset.
And that can't happen in a classroom.
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
But we had parents who said, "Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English?
Show us the grades."
And we did. The data was conclusive.
When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well, in fact very well,
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science.
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press, businesses, and basically said, "When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
So, how did the city respond?
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
Video: [Unclear] So, the busiest streets closed down.
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
It gets taken over by children.
They are skating. They are doing street plays.
They are playing, all free, for all children.
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city.
KBS: And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools.
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.
We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives.
And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India, from Nagaland in the east, to Jhunjhunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan.
I mean, it was incredible.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, "You can," then they will.
Infection in India.
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school -- unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says.
Man: This program is wonderful.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
See? They have done it.
KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555.
KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out, pretty difficult, but they did it.
Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them.
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
Street plays, auctions, petitions.
I mean, they were changing lives.
It was incredible.
So, how can we still stay immune?
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can."
So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India?
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
So, if not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
Like I said, contagious is a good word.
Thank you.
Anil Gupta is on the hunt for the developing world's unsung inventors -- indigenous entrepreneurs whose ingenuity, hidden by poverty, could change many people's lives. He shows how the Honey Bee Network helps them build the connections they need -- and gain the recognition they deserve.
I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages, in the slums, in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius, without any outside help.
When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India, about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable, he missed the point.
The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years, the point that people may be economically poor, but they're not poor in the mind.
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds.
That is the message, which we started 31 years ago.
And what did it start?
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey, which led me to come to this point.
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands, on the fields of the poor people, and how to develop research technologies, which are based on the knowledge of the people.
I came back in '86. I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country, which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity.
I started looking at my own work:
The work that I had done for the previous 10 years, almost every time, had instances of knowledge that people had shared.
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant, and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return, which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible?
Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
Is it that I write very well?
Is it that I articulate very well?
Is it that I analyze the data very well?
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore, I must be entitled to this reward from society?"
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no, I have worked for the policy changes.
You know, the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor, and, therefore I think it's okay."
But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords, by moneylenders, by traders -- gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter, because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --
and nothing ever went back to them. So much so, that much of my work till that time was in the English language.
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
I was talking about social justice, and here I was, a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous, getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and publishing them in the papers, getting invited to the conferences, getting consultancies and whatever have you.
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that, if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;
life cannot go on like that.
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer.
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research, wrote, read about 100 papers.
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique, dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
And one day -- I don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home, maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee, life would be wonderful.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
And when it takes the nectar, the flowers don't feel shortchanged.
In fact, they invite the honey bees through their colors,
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:
that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language.
They must not remain anonymous.
And I must tell you that after 20 years, I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art.
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous.
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
We are talking about an accountable society, a society that is fair and just,
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
And India wants to be a knowledge society.
How will it be a knowledge society?
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice, one for yourself and one for others.
It must be the same.
You cannot discriminate.
You cannot be in favor of your own values, which are at a distance from the values that you espouse.
So, fairness to one and to the other is not divisible.
Look at this picture.
Can you tell me where has it been taken from, and what is it meant for? Anybody?
I'm a professor; I must quiz you.
Anybody? Any guess at all?
Pardon?
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
Pardon?
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand, because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country.
I'm so sorry to say that.
Is this a beautiful picture
or is it a terrible picture?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles, you cannot be celebrating that.
We should be doing something about it.
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command, millions of women still carry water on their heads.
And we do not ask this question.
You must have taken tea in the morning.
Think for a minute.
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes; you know what the action is? The action is:
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
Just do it 10 times; you will realize the pain in this shoulder.
And she does it a few thousand times every day.
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today, is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture,
millions of them, every season, in the paddy season, when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water.
And feet in the water will develop fungus, infections,
and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point.
And every year, 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
No machines have been developed.
So the silence of scientists, of technologists, of public policy makers, of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on; this is not the way society will work.
This is not what our parliament would do. You know,
we have a program for employment:
One hundred, 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
So we asked a question to the parliament: Do poor have heads?
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.
And what has happened?
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person gets in contact with the network, and then gets an identity.
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.
And this network grew voluntarily, continues to be voluntary,
and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
They could be creative in terms of education,
they may be creative in terms of culture,
they may be creative in terms of institutions;
but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity, the innovations, either in terms of contemporary innovations, or in terms of traditional knowledge.
And it all begins with curiosity.
It all begins with curiosity.
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website, www.sristi.org -- this tribal person, he had a wish.
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- "God, please cure him.
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
And this is what he got painted.
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints, they were all poor people, and they had a great reason.
Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
Look at this.
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk in different parts of the country.
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
So on the wayside we found these dung cakes, which are used as a fuel.
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap, has made a painting.
That's the only space she could express her creativity.
And she's so marvelous.
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi, on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra
and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy, pain of indigo growers.
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
Look at what she has done.
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
Is she an artisan or an artist?
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
If we can create markets for these artists, we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
Look at what Rojadeen has done.
In Motihari in Champaran, there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
So he thought, why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
People bring their own cooker, he attaches a valve and a steam pipe, and now he gives you espresso coffee.
Now, this is a real, affordable coffee percolator that works on gas.
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground.
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram, he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
Please understand the problem of poor people.
They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
But to be able to give them high-quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs.
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them, he brought a washing machine to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ... He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
You bring your water, you bring your soap,
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee for you per lot,
and a new business model can emerge.
Now, what we need is, we need people who will be able to scale them up.
Look at this.
It looks like a beautiful photograph.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
Somebody from India would know, of course.
It's a tawa.
It's a hot plate made of clay.
Now, what is the beauty in it?
When you have a non-stick pan, it costs about, maybe, 250 rupees, five dollars, six dollars.
This is less than a dollar
and this is non-stick;
it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.
You know? But here in this clay hot plate, it will never go into your stomach. So it is better, it is safer; it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable.
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.
He has designed this plate with a handle.
And now with one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you.
This lady, she developed a herbal pesticide formulation.
We filed the patent for her, the National Innovation Foundation.
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products,
and she would get revenue.
Now, let me mention one thing:
I think we need a polycentric model of development, where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country, in different parts of the world, would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner.
Higher the local fit, greater is the chance of scaling up.
In the scaling up, there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people, point by point, with the supply that you're making.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone, only three options on the cellphone. It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
But if I had to get a match to match, obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability.
There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality, and yet, one can be able to fund them.
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- "What is a scalable model?" --
as if the need of a community, which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places, has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale.
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out.
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books, for example, having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model.
And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio, where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities, and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
Look at what he is doing.
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
At the age of 70, he is linking up something very creative.
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
I had to meet my love.
My desperation made me an innovator.
Even love needs help from technology.
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
New inventions are the passion of my life.
My technology.
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari, again in Champaran.
Wonderful human being, but he stills sells, at this age, honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood, because we haven't been able to convince the water park people, the lake people, in [unclear] operations.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device, as a vending device during the floods in eastern India, when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned.
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more, but he has left behind a message. A very powerful message
Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
It's not that a coconut fell on my head,
and I came upon this idea.
With no money to fund my studies, I scaled new heights.
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.
My technology.
AG: Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what I call a G2G model, grassroots to global.
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts, in the zoology department, bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy.
And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms, rather than only a few, because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
Remya Jose has developed ...
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos.
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th: a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person, one and a half foot height, only.
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility.
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara. We were talking about, my friends in Brazil, how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly, but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
India and China have the largest number of cycles. But this innovation emerged in Brazil.
The point is, none of us should be parochial,
none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country.
No, we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations: cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road.
I can't change the condition of the road,
but I can make the cycle run faster.
That is what Kanak Das has done.
And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators, and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have.
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg, serving no purpose.
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
These three people in the village sat down and decided to think, "How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out, "How can we use ... "
They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life, and she's very welcome.
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.
A car, which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer.
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe, but this is available in India.
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree.
In one day, 18,000 times, she had to do this winding to generate two sarees.
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
She said, "Change your profession."
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine, which will solve your problem."
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
So, this is what SRISTI is saying: "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things.
We have sold things all over the world, from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
Products have gone to the market, a few.
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
If you have an idea, send it back to us."
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters, innovations transform, incentives inspire.
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
Thank you.
Lighting architect Rogier van der Heide offers a beautiful new way to look at the world -- by paying attention to light . Examples from classic buildings illustrate a deeply thought-out vision of the play of light around us.
There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says, "Light creates ambiance, light makes the feel of a space, and light is also the expression of structure." Well that was not by me.
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect.
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness.
So this is how we normally would light our offices.
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity.
This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps.
And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier.
If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome, it would never have looked like this, because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building.
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort." And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal, but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people.
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun.
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.
What it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.
And this image of the sun may suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive,
but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the sun,
and light is only a manifestation of that energy.
The sun is for dynamics, for color changes. The sun is for beauty in our environment, like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta, which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers, who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space, responding to what the sun does outside, just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.
So in an indirect way, you can see the sun.
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
They created this shade that you can see here, which actually covers the sun, but opens up to the good light from the sky.
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative, as well as qualitative, methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture.
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor, but they could easily figure out where that comes from.
And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun, the good part of the sun.
And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course.
It can be just like this, or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar, but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.
And it's just a bit bright up there, so these people have found a very intriguing solution.
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building, creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.
And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness, of course, because otherwise you don't see these dynamics.
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the White Group.
They are in green energy consulting, or something like that.
And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.
It has only on one side this big, big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work, and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.
But actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull, and therefore helps us to enhance our lives.
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you.
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago, which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design.
And he coined three terms, which are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence" and "play of the brilliants" -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience.
So you begin with focal glow.
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around.
Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did for General Motors, for the car showroom.
And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
To me it is something from theatre, and I will get back to that a little bit later.
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment.
Or it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment -- lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.
Ambient luminescence is something very different.
Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite, something without any focus, something where all details actually dissolve in infinity.
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate.
It could also be something like this: the National Museum of Science in London, where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture.
And then finally, Kelly's play of brilliants attitude,
that really some play of the skyline of Hong Kong, or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house, or in the theater here, which is a decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful, something that is just an addition to the architectural environment, I would say.
These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.
And we can only create these out of darkness.
And I will explain that further.
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left, was explaining to Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe.
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.
Those times, there were some early attempts also for light therapy already.
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine, where people are put in the sun to get better.
It's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light, than what I'm telling you today.
In today's modern medicine, there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way.
And there is the idea that, when we look at things, it is the yellow light that helps us the most, that we are the most sensitive for.
But our circadian rhythms, which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on, they are much more triggered by blue light.
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep, or to stay awake.
And that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals to make people better sooner, recover them quicker.
Maybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that.
Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work.
And you can imagine a lot more applications.
But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life.
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other.
And it is all about this planet.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
Because all this light here goes up to the sky. It never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
It never is to the benefit of people.
It only spoils the darkness.
So at a global scale, it looks like this.
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground.
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be, it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything.
The world is changing though, and urbanization is a big driver of everything.
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou, and I realized that 10 years ago, there was nothing like this, of these buildings.
It was just a much smaller city, and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous.
And we have to understand these main questions: How do people move through these new urban spaces?
How do they share their culture?
How do we tackle things like mobility?
And how can light help there?
Because the new technologies, they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments.
It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
And of course, we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that.
Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness.
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think, and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind.
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger, so you would not to be able to really see them.
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it, and they said, "Well, we can do something."
They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
So here it is.
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger.
And I will very quickly show you how it works.
So just to explain.
Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable.
And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
And then when you add the lens to that, you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light.
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.
Thank you.
We can go further.
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities.
We have to think again about light as a default solution.
Why are all these motorways permanently lit?
Is it really needed?
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness?
Can we be more gentle with light?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually.
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create, so they really want to connect with it, like here?
Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around?
And can we preserve the darkness?
Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very, very challenging.
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being.
And it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms.
And we discovered that, when we make those lights green, the birds, they actually go the right way.
They are not disturbed anymore.
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here.
In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting.
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
Where have they come from? Where are they going?
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light.
Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark.
And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
We can do that in commercial spaces like this.
And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself.
So I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky, ranging from the inner city, where you may see one or two stars and nothing else, all the way to the rural environments, where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars.
In architecture, it works just the same.
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light, you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives.
This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of Light.
But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals, where light and dark, in very gentle combinations, alter each other to define the space.
Or Richard McCormack's Southern tube station in London, where you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.
And finally I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.
It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater.
And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.
Thank you very much.
Inventor Dean Kamen lays out his argument for the Segway and offers a peek into his next big ideas .
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
I could have told them that.
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff.
That's reassuring.
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
I would love to talk about the technology, and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes, I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what's in here.
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology.
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community.
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
And it is certainly a wonder.
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
But think about where the world is today.
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
That's 3.2 billion people.
We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough; we found a new continent.
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power, that we turned the continent into a country.
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities.
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half.
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around.
Nobody would want to give them up.
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities.
And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you, but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air, and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane, and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient, both from an engineering point of view, an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
And we all love our cars, and I do.
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
It's not sustainable.
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars.
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --
and it's not sustainable politically.
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,
but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
And every one of those industries, by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law.
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane.
Every other form of transportation's been improved.
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
The 20 largest cities in the world.
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities?
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly?
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again?
We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk? Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
I don't look like a motor vehicle.
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff. Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work.
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, "Can I try that?"
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?
And so I said, "Sure."
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah, then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet, and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says, "Finally, they made something for us."
And the camera is looking down at her.
I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great -- -- please lady, don't say another word."
And the camera is down at her, and this guy has to put the microphone in her face, said, "What do you mean by that?"
And I figured, "It's all over now," and she looks up and she says, "Well," she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no, she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades," she knew them by name; she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, "And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore. I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left, the sidewalks in these cities.
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk, then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes, and then the other eight feet -- it's -- that little piece is all that's there.
But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry.
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years, the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys, call AARP, get an appointment right away.
We've got to show them this thing.
And they took it to Washington; they showed them; and they're going to be involved now, watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities, like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact, help re-energize their downtown.
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities.
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
They learned to start with cell phones.
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
They start at the top of the technology food chain.
We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
You do it in your sneakers.
Not much has changed.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --
we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars.
But if you could put a pin in most cities, and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car, re-park your car and go somewhere; you can't get to a cab or a subway.
We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun.
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel, because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact, where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars.
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove, if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb.
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour, it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place, turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
We need water.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it.
So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
I don't know, but we'll try it.
I better shut up.
Animal fan Nellie McKay sings a sparkling tribute to her dear dog. She suggests we all do the same: "Just go right to the pound/ And find yourself a hound/ And make that doggie proud/ 'cause that's what it's all about."
I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.
But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.
♫ Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ ♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun.

Thank you.
Chris Anderson, the editor of <em>WIRED</em>, explores the four key stages of any viable technology: setting the right price, gaining market share, displacing an established technology and, finally, becoming ubiquitous.
I'd like to speak about technology trends, which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow, for related reasons.
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about.
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product
that's based on technology trends.
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
And so we have to understand not only why tech's important, where it's going, but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
You've probably seen something like this before.
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that, we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,
and maybe how you can do something about it.
The first is the critical price.
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend, if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point.
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change.
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi -- you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that.
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house; you've got high-quality digital video; you have a reason to have a big-screen television; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
The next phase it hit was displacement.
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm, who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD.
But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper, the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share, and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology, these four stages of technology's life.
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods.
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
Start with gene sequencing.
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part, because it's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
It is now possible -- will be possible, and if Craig Venter indeed comes today, he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer.
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
Today it's less than 50 cents a day.
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa.
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. Linux is another good example.
Now we've switched to critical mass.
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. Interestingly, it's done a crossover before, but not the crossovers that matter.
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going, you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
It's not just for the geeks any more.
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales.
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire; you can have replaceable body shapes -- it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid, but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass.
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry. It's going to look a little bit like that.
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.
Free is something that comes with digital, because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP, because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics, because there's so much bandwidth.
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
It's an economic force; it's a technical force.
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
Free is probably the most interesting thing.
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive.
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table.
And you've seen the numbers.
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this.
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free.
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute.
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly, but then there was just so much fiber out there, you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling, to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today.
The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt.
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
Thank you.
The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust "charity" against those who mistrust reliance on the markets. Jacqueline Novogratz proposes a middle way she calls patient capital, with promising examples of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change.
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us,
and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid,
but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society,
and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation,
and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure --
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.
At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves,
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest,
or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average,
but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.
Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women,
and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.
This idea of scale is critical.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
President Obama understands that.
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it.
And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
People like Rashani Zafar,
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja,
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore." When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental,
and that power without love is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us,
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience,
but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.
The founding mother of the blog revolution, Movable Type's Mena Trott, talks about the early days of blogging, when she realized that giving regular people the power to share our lives online is the key to building a friendlier, more connected world.
Over the past couple of days as I've been preparing for my speech, I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.
Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
And -- So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve wracking.
But then I started thinking about my family.
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my blood stream -- -- that I had to consider this "my element."
So, who am I?
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
We have about 125 people internationally.
If you looked in the book, you saw this, which I really was appalled by.
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides, since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs, I made a graph that moves, and I talk about the makeup of me.
So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide. This is math, and this is science; this is genetics.
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
I'm a blogger, which, probably to a lot of you, means different things.
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack, or break into, a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
You may have heard about Rathergate, which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the "th" in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter; it's on Word.
Bloggers exposed this, or they worked hard to expose this.
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
I see this, and I'm sure scared -- and I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs, because this is not something that's friendly.
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and, you know, these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.
During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
You have my friend, who has a blog on digital -- on PDRs, personal recorders.
He makes enough money, just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.
That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.
It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
Children with cleft palates will get it, and they document their story. This is wonderful.
I am not that caring.
I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger.
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it.
And -- the short story about my blog: it started in 2001. I was 23.
I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.
I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing. So, I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories.
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old, and how I went to a YMCA camp -- Christian camp -- and basically by the end, I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk. They couldn't find me.
They sent a search party, and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself, jumped off Bible Peak.
You can laugh, this is OK.
This is me.
This is what happened to me.
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal -- I said, I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet.
And I set a goal. I said, "I'm going to win an award," because I had never won an award in my entire life.
And I said, "I'm going to win this award -- the South by Southwest Weblog award."
And I won it. I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday.
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money,
and I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music.
I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing,
and I said, "I could do that." And I said to my husband, I said, "Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
And my husband -- this is my husband, who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me, "You cannot buy a banjo. You're just like your dad," who "collects" instruments.
And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo.
And those people who know me understood my joke.
This is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant: this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today -- he would kill me.
But the thing was, I wrote this, and my friends read it, and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about, you know, wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
But I got emails from people that said, "Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?
You could take that money and buy your banjo.
Why don't you open a separate account?"
I've been with him since I was 17 years old. We've never had a separate bank account.
They said, "Separate your bank account -- spend your money; spend his money. That's it."
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."
And -- I was like, "OK, what, who are these people? And why are they reading this?"
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
And I started to kill my blog slowly.
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore, and I slowly and slowly -- And I did tell personal stories from time to then.
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
And I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet, and she passed away two years ago.
And I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life," because I wanted to give her a little memorial.
But anyways.
It's these sort of personal stories. You know, you read the blogs about politics, or about media, and gossip and all these things.
These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is -- this is who I am.
You see Norman Rockwell. And you have art critics say, "Norman Rockwell is not art.
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art."
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans.
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all biblical stories, and then you have this.
These are the blogs that interest me: the people who just tell stories.
One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.
His father was a blogger.
And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks.
And he never expected this.
One day it was normal; the next day it was hell.
And this is a one-pound baby.
So Odin was documented every single day.
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.
His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image, but just -- just so heartfelt.
You're reading this as this happens, so on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures: breathing failures and heart failures, and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
But then it gets better. Day 96 he goes home.
And you see this post.
That's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels, and people are excited about it.
Twenty-eight comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter.
And today he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog -- it's Snowdeal.org, his father's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
So, blogs.
So what? You've probably heard these things before.
We talked about the WELL, and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history.
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today.
It's this record of who you are, your persona.
You have your Google search where you say, "Hey, what is Mena Trott?"
And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel, and I am very optimistic.
Whenever I think about blogs I'm like, "Oh, we've got to reach all these people."
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people.
You know, we're getting into China, we want to be there, but you know, there are so many people who won't have the access to write a blog.
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because it's a -- blogging software is simple.
We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science.
And so, that's an amazing thing to consider.
So, the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.
We started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew that the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow, because she does read my blog -- and she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
This is my mom. So, I have all of the people that I know of.
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one I grew up with, looking at constantly.
I would spend hours looking at just the connections,
saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there."
And just these little things. This is not science, but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line.
So, that has always influenced me.
I have this record, this 1910 census of another Grabowski -- that's my maiden name -- and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
This is all I have. I have a couple of facts about somebody.
I have their date of birth, and their age, and what they did in their household, if they spoke English,
and that's it. That's all I know of these people.
And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and then it's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
And just doing this I spent time in the archives -- that's another thing why my husband's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there, looking for these things. Now it's online, but he sat through that.
And so you have this record and, you know, this is my great-great-grandmother.
This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing.
Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
And he's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past, what is '76 -- 20, oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years? Twenty-nine years.
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: you see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.
So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year, and that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
I wish that I would have this of my family.
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was, so I do something that's very narcissistic:
I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time everyday.
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year -- every single day.
And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.
Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.
About four people probably read it, and they tell me, you know, "You haven't updated" -- I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated -- but this is something that's amazing, because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly.
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one-day trip.
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things.
It's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
If you look at my driver's license I have the same look, and it's -- it's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it's something that is really important.
And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing.
And I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened -- you know, there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
She was writing and writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.
And she was writing one day, and, you know, then she disappeared for a little bit.
And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company.
And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.
That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing.
But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said, you know,
and she wrote on this blog, that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people, being able to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments.
And that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.
That was an amazing thing.
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it out at her memorial service, and even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life.
And that's a huge thing.
So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: you know, think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that is really going to change our lives.
So, thank you.
Tuna are ocean athletes -- fast, far-ranging predators whose habits we're just beginning to understand. Marine biologist Barbara Block fits tuna with tracking tags that record unprecedented amounts of data about these gorgeous, threatened fish and the ocean habitats they move through.
I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty, form and function of giant bluefin tuna.
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.
They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming.
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift, powers its movements with a lunate tail.
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water.
This is what one of nature's finest machines.
Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history.
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years.
This fish was revered by humankind.
It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation.
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go --
there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin.
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently.
And yet, the type of fishing going on today, with pens, with enormous stakes, is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet.
Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious.
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton.
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population, there's been tremendous decline on both sides, as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950.
For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas.
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
And if it's tunas you don't care about, perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks, sharks, marlin, albatross.
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries.
The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna, and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey.
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room.
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way.
Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely.
And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works.
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
We don't know where the structure is.
We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross.
We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm.
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it.
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome.
So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips.
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before.
And for the first time, we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset.
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning, we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean, one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by.
We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity.
They're flying through their space, ocean space.
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty.
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
We'd been studying these fish,
but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
What do they like to eat?
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --
it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption.
We're taking this data and building better models.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder: how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
So take a look at that animal.
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.
Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain.
We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas.
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
We see a flick of the tail.
And from our data that gets collected, when that tag comes back, because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward, we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now, on a backboned animal.
Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket.
But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in.
In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
This tag rides on the tuna, senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish, detach, float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag, pressure data and temperature data.
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag.
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America.
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today.
One community in general has given more to help us than any other community.
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City, every winter for over a decade, held a party called Tag-A-Giant, and together, fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish.
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample.
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,
we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean.
And this is my favorite.
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --
but it can't get there. It's too cold.
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas.
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
Three tunas tagged.
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --
and there it is.
That is where the tuna spawn.
So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging.
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side.
So two populations of tunas -- that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag -- they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that -- and a second population.
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med.
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations.
And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission, building new models, showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day, used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model isn't the right model.
This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward.
So we can then predict where management places should be.
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured.
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job.
But in the international realm, where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild, these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," -- we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag.
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message.
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data.
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen.
They can throw out a target -- it's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
It's a several thousand-pound animal.
And we'll wind in the target.
And we'll place an acoustic tag that says, "OMSHARK 10165," or something like that, acoustically with a ping.
And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish.
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,
and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues, blue sharks.
And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
We have white sharks and blue sharks.
For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go.
They get returned, and when they get returned, here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor, returning to the Western Pacific.
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data.
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags, light-based tags, that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back, journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before.
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys.
Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes, up to the same zone the tunas use.
You can see why they might be caught.
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are.
And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey.
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are.
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean.
And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots.
So this is just three years of data right here --
and there's a decade of this data.
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on.
So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast,
that appears to be a gathering place.
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us.
They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles.
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public,
to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And now with Google's Oceans,
we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii.
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see.
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
We just need to put it together.
So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast.
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity.
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere?
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
Make killer apps, if you will.
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
That way we do away with a few internet myths.
So we can save the bluefin tuna.
We can save the white shark.
We have the science and technology.
Hope is here. Yes we can.
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans.
Thank you.
After he ended up on a watch list by accident, Hasan Elahi was advised by his local FBI agents to let them know when he was traveling. He did that and more ... much more.
Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?" or "What kind of medium do you work in?" Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique.
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.
So let me show you a little of that.
So it started over here.
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" -- all these little details.
And then literally just out of nowhere, the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?" And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?" or any date for that fact, it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."
So I pulled out my little PDA, and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class, 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?" "Where were you the 29th? the 30th?" "Where were you October 5th?" We read about six months of my calendar.
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did.
But good thing I did, because I don't look good in orange.
So he asked me -- "So this storage unit that you paid the rent on, what did you have in it?" This was in Tampa, Florida, so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.
Just assorted garage sale junk, because I'm a pack rat."
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?" I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
And if there were, I would have remembered that one."
And he's still a little confused, but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.
And so we're sitting there, and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth, he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it." I was like, "Great."
So I got home and the phone rings, and a man introduced himself.
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth, not six months continuously.
By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you.
So to the folks from Google, thank you.
So I spent a lot of time in this building.
Questions like: "Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?" And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this.
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death.
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph, which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ... well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.
Then, of course, the next question is: "Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?" I work at a university.
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly." But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?" I was like, "No."
So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, "Hey, everything's fine."
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.
I know everything's fine." So they're looking at me really odd.
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."
This is with the FBI.
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again." And there was a sincere concern there.
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble, give us a call -- we'll take care of it."
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th" or whatever.
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys. Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves." "I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
Just letting you know. Heads up." And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
And then the phone calls turned into emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... with pictures, with travel tips.
Then I'd make websites.
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.
So I actually designed this back in 2003.
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.
I wrote some code for my mobile phone.
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
But I'll watch myself. It's okay.
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.
And I'll help you out.
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?
Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.
So you can see, Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta.
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco.
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that, but they'll give it to me on the plane.
These are the airports that I hang out in, because I like airports.
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.
This is in Warsaw.
Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone.
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data, then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together.
And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence, you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
At the time that this was going on, the last thing on my mind was "art project."
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project.
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know.
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday, November 15th.
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.
And I bought some crabs too right around there, and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland, sorry.
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.
Now if you go to my bank records, it'll actually show something from there, so you know that, on May 9th, that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there, but now there's a third party, an independent third party, my bank, that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.
And there's a verification taking place.
Sometimes they're really small purchases.
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts, and everything pops up right away.
Sometimes there's a lot of information.
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.
And then sometimes you get this.
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd.
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was, because this is what I had to do with the FBI.
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.
I spend a lot of time on the road.
This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada off of Route 80 at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.
So there's multiple databases.
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site, and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they've seen all of them.
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed.
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.
So you get something like this.
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich.
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations.
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.
So again, you have to do some detective work here.
So sometimes the databases get so specific.
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth.
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.
So I time-stamp my life every few moments.
Every few moments I shoot the image.
Now it's all done on my iPhone, and it all goes straight up to my server, and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together.
They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business.
So on December 4th, I went here.
And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.
So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information.
If you go to my site, there's tons of things.
And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.
It's actually quite user-unfriendly.
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness, is that everything is there, but you have to really work through it.
So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out, I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.
And you know very little about me actually.
And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy, particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded, there's no need to delete information anymore.
So what do you do when everything is out there?
Well you have to take control over it.
And if I give you this information directly, it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information.
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it.
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency.
And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic.
But if 300 million people in the U.S. started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up.
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
And we're getting to that.
When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, "Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?
Why are you posting these photos?" This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people.
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it.
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not.
So we're creating our own archives and so on.
And you know, some of my friends have always said, "Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?
Because no one's really watching.
No one's really going to bother you." So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.
Because it's about surveillance.
I'm watching who's watching me.
And I came up with these.
So these are some of my sample logs.
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security.
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.
Central Intelligence Agency.
Executive Office of the President.
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.
I think they kind of like to look at art.
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.
So thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone," but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
So how many hours of the day does that take?
HE: Almost none.
It's no different than sending a text.
It's no different than checking an email.
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.
So it's just become another day.
I mean, when we update a status message, we don't really think about how long that's going to take.
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done.
And everything's automated at the other end.
BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.
So it holds onto the very last point.
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from.
BG: Hasan, thank you very much.
We feel instinctively that societies with huge income gaps are somehow going wrong. Richard Wilkinson charts the hard data on economic inequality, and shows what gets worse when rich and poor are too far apart: real effects on health, lifespan, even such basic values as trust.
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
It's infant mortality.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.
In this talk from 2003, design critic Don Norman turns his incisive eye toward beauty, fun, pleasure and emotion, as he looks at design that makes people happy. He names the three emotional cues that a well-designed product must hit to succeed.
The new me is beauty.
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly."
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...
This is neat.
Thank you for setting up my display.
I mean, it's just wonderful.
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for, but I want it.
And that's my new life.
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about, and "pretty," and "emotions."
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
The acid will ruin the gold plating.
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
It's a delight to use.
And so it's got everything, right?
It's beautiful and it's functional.
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
And those are the three components.
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it, and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it.
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table, the ripples spread out and the fish run away.
But of course, then the ball hits the other side, the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?
No. But is it fun?
Yeah! Yeah.
Or look at Google.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.
This is one through 20. Next," they just give you as many o's as there are pages.
It's really simple and subtle.
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why.
And it's just clever.
And of course, what's especially good is, if you type "design and emotion," the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
Now, the weird thing is Google lies, because if I type "design and emotion," it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway." So, OK. So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
It was third.
Oh well, different story.
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile.
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
Buy it anyway.
It's so much fun to drive."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
It's round, it's neat.
The controls work wonderfully.
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better, and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ...
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long
and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,
I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
No problem.
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air --
and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
It actually affects the way the brain works.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. That's what fear and anxiety does; it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus, not be distracted. And I couldn't force myself across that.
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.
But it really changes the way you think.
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen, did this wonderful experiment.
She brought students in to solve problems.
So, she'd bring people into the room, and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here. It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff.
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
Still can't reach it.
And, basically, none of them could solve it.
You bring in a second group of people, and you say, "Oh, before we start, I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
Would you like the box of candy?"
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy --
not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
And guess what -- they solved the problem.
And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you makes you depth-first. And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes, which makes you a breadth-first problem solver: you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
That's what brainstorming is about, right?
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games, and we say, "No criticism," and you get all these weird, neat ideas. But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
You've got be anxious.
The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative. You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
No big deal.
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants, because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed.
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds, we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces; we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
So that's the visceral level. In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways, like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
Or the 1963 Jaguar:
It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time, but the owners love it.
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
A water bottle:
You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away. They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
It's all about the visceral experience.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it. Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Almost everything we do is subconscious.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
Most of what we do is subconscious.
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious, controlled by the behavioral side.
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control, which includes usability, understanding -- but also the feel and heft.
That's why the Global knives are so neat. They're so nicely balanced, so sharp, that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
Or the sensual feeling.
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower, and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours --
and not waste water, by the way, because it recirculates the same dirty water.
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back, and you put tea in, and then you fill it with water. The water then seeps over the tea.
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
And when it's finished, you put it vertically, and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out. On top of that, it communicates, which is what emotion does.
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
It's being safe in the world.
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
Well, this has emotions if you like, because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles.
It looks over what's going on.
It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
Here's a great reflective product.
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars, but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."
It's about attention. It's about their image, not about the car.
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car.
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
And you'll buy it to protect the environment, even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected.
But that's reflective design as well.
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people -- "Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
As opposed to this one, which is a pure behavioral watch, which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
But it's ugly.
This is a clear Don Norman watch.
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other, the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
So, it's pitting one against the other.
The other neat thing ... So Jake Cress is this furniture maker, and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.
And this is his chair with claw, and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
And that's what's nice about emotion.
So that's the new me.
I'm only saying positive things from now on.
Speaking at LIFT 2007, Sugata Mitra talks about his Hole in the Wall project. Young kids in this project figured out how to use a PC on their own -- and then taught other kids. He asks, what else can children teach themselves?
I have a tough job to do.
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context.
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas -- it's like four pieces of a puzzle.
And if I succeed in doing that, maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education.
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
What happens to education?
The second, or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world, you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas, which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
What happens to education in that context?
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers.
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers. They do not have good enough infrastructure.
And if they had some infrastructure, they have difficulty maintaining it.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
That seemed a little damning, and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure, or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
To my surprise, it did not correlate.
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way.
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result.
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about.
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment, if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo, and he said something which completely solves this problem.
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education.
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area, but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem, because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like.
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
And this is what we saw.
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
About eight hours later, we found this kid.
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English?
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them?
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it, this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India, where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there; he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television where you can do something."
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television.
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen, and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here.
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there.
So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages. So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language? That's not possible.
So, it has to be the other way about.
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all.
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later.
So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
And as soon as they saw me they said, "We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
I was real surprised.
You know, how on earth did they know all this?
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced, but correct usage -- words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing, not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to.
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities.
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world.
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs, so I needed different climates, for which India is also great, because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet.
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages, where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power, so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running.
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old, telling his eldest sister what to do.
And this happens very often with these computers, that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure.
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups.
So here was the power of what a group of children can do, if you lift the adult intervention.
Just a quick idea of the measurements.
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
What could they learn to do?
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email, games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.
In short, what all of us do.
And over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
So, how do they do that?
If you calculated the actual time of access, it would work out to minutes per day, so that's not how it's happening.
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.
And surrounding him are usually three other children, who are advising him on what they should do.
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children, who are also advising, usually wrongly, about everything that's going on on the computer.
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning, but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told, don't do this, you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.
So what does the eight-year-old do?
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic.
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own.
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you, that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly, I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,
and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
These were areas where the children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no.
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question; perhaps none of us do.
So I leave you with this third question.
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?
Finally, self-organizing systems, about which, again, I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it.
Natural systems are all self-organizing: galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer.
But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization.
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
So here are my four sentences then.
Remoteness affects the quality of education.
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later.
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms.
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology, but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs, and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness, values and violence.
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future? So I want to leave that as a thought with you.
Thank you.
After 15 years in the British diplomatic corps, Carne Ross became a "freelance diplomat," running a bold nonprofit that gives small, developing and yet-unrecognized nations a voice in international relations. At the BIF-5 conference, he calls for a new kind of diplomacy that gives voice to small countries, that works with changing boundaries and that welcomes innovation.
My story is a little bit about war.
It's about disillusionment.
It's about death.
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage.
And perhaps also, there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed-up, fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century.
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.
I don't believe in a life or history written as decision "A" led to consequence "B" led to consequence "C" -- these neat narratives that we're presented with, and that perhaps we encourage in each other.
I believe in randomness, and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random.
I'm colorblind.
I was born unable to see most colors.
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time, and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes.
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside.
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot, and sure enough, I failed.
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights, and I can't distinguish color.
So I had to choose another career, and this was in fact relatively easy for me, because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood, which was international relations.
As a child, I read the newspaper thoroughly.
I was fascinated by the Cold War, by the INF negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles, the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in Angola or Afghanistan.
These things really interested me.
And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat.
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
And he turned to me, and he said, "Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
And my ambition was sealed.
In 1989, I entered the British Foreign Service.
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat, and 20 of us succeeded.
And as those numbers suggest, I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world.
Being a diplomat, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --
I enjoyed the status of it.
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events.
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry.
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary.
I met Yasser Arafat.
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
Later, I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan, surrounded by my Special Forces escort, who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines, because it was so dangerous.
And that was exciting -- that was fun.
It was really interesting.
And it's a great cadre of people, incredibly close-knit community of people.
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out, was when I was posted to New York.
I'd already served in Germany, Norway, various other places, but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
And my responsibility was the Middle East,
which was my specialty.
And there, I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process, the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later, if you wish -- but above all, my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject, and I was steeped in the issue.
And anyway, my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
We went through several wars during my time in New York. I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before, which were, of course, deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time.
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times kind of experience.
I lived the high-life.
Although I worked very long hours, I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant.
I had a good time.
But in 2002, when my tour came to an end, I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London.
I decided to take a sabbatical, in fact, at the New School, Bruce.
In some inchoate, inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work, with me.
I was exhausted, and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.
And I decided to take some time out from work.
The Foreign Office was very generous.
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them, and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.
It was nice.
And eventually, I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo, which was then under U.N. administration.
And two things happened in Kosovo, which kind of, again, shows the randomness of life, because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage.
But they were random things.
One was that, in the summer of 2004, the British government, somewhat reluctantly, decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War, a very limited subject.
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD, and my testimony to the inquiry said three things: that the government exaggerated the intelligence, which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war, which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still.
The third reason, I won't go into.
But anyway, I gave that testimony, and that presented me with a crisis.
What was I going to do?
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues, of my ministers, who had, in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.
And so I was in crisis.
And this wasn't a pretty thing.
I moaned about it, I hesitated, I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife, and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know, where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy, and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken." And it was like that for me. I love that movie.
I felt just something's broken.
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them.
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff.
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.
And I started to fall.
And today, that fall hasn't stopped;
I'm still falling.
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.
And in a way, I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff, wondering what to do.
A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.
A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of delivered the answer, which I couldn't really answer, which is, "What do I do with my life?"
I love diplomacy --
I have no career --
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
I wanted to be an ambassador, and my mentors, my heroes, people who got to the top of my profession, and here I was throwing it all away.
A lot of my friends were still in it.
My pension was in it.
And I gave it up.
And what was I going to do?
And that year, in Kosovo, this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.
In March 2004, there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.
18 people were killed.
It was anarchy.
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy, to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street.
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing.
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.
And that riot taught me something, which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.
But one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots, which went on for several days, took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future.
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then, and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people, were not actually participating in those talks.
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system, this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo, and the Kosovars weren't part of it.
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives.
It was a complicated thing, and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
But that was one of the reasons.
And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise, it gave my wife the inspiration.
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
They were not allowed diplomats.
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process, which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. And so that was the idea.
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat, the world's first diplomatic advisory group
and a non-profit to boot.
And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him, "Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said, "Yes, Carne. Come."
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government.
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.
And Kosovo became independent.
Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world, and we're advising seven or eight different countries, or political groups, depending on how you wish to define them -- and I'm not big on definitions.
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.
We're advising the Burmese opposition, the government of Southern Sudan, which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years.
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara, who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession.
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations, which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen.
There's a bit of randomness here too because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat, I went to a party in the House of Lords, which is a ridiculous place, but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me.
And we started talking, and he said -- I told him what I was doing, and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York.
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"
And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,
which some of you have probably heard of.
And one thing led to another, and I ended up having a desk in ?What If! in New York, when I started Independent Diplomat.
And watching ?What If!
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy, like business, is a business of solving problems, and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy; it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things.
And Independent Diplomat, today, tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.
And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with, but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients.
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition, are having a difficult time, diplomatically.
There are, I don't know, some lessons from all of this, personal and political -- and in a way, they're the same thing.
The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world, which is that the world is fragmenting.
States mean less than they used to, and the power of the state is declining.
That means the power of others things is rising.
Those other things are called non-state actors.
They may be corporations, they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs, they may anything, any number of things.
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.
If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world, then that means, who is left to deal with them, who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?
Us.
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.
What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations, or global affairs, or chaos in Somalia, or what's going on in Burma is none of your business, and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough, but that connection is there.
We are all intimately connected.
And this isn't just Tom Friedman, it's actually provable in case after case after case.
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things, you have to look to yourself to do things.
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way.
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this: the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work -- the U.N. Security Council.
The U.N. was established in 1945.
Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict.
Today, 80 percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states, involving non-state parties -- guerillas, separatists, terrorists, if you want to call them that, people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.
That is the state of the world today.
When I realized this, and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars, and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there, weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council, I thought, this is wrong.
Something's got to be done about this.
So I started off in a traditional mode.
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council.
We went around 70 U.N. member states -- the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis -- you name them, we went to see them -- the secretary general, all of them, and said, "This is all wrong.
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think.
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.
It'll be great. You can have an exchange.
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions, which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."
Super-logical, you would think.
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.
Come back to us in maybe six months."
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.
The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago, when I was there 10 years ago.
So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought, what can we do about it.
And I thought, I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done.
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
So now, Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council.
So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups, the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots, rebels from Aceh, and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world.
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council, and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want.
So there's actually a conversation, which has never before happened.
And of course, describing all this, any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult, and I entirely agree with you.
The chances of failure are very high, but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen.
And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today, and I think that outputs is what matters, not process, not technology, frankly, so much either.
Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran, where Ahmadinejad remains in power.
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself, "What can I do to produce that particular output?"
That is the politics of the 21st century,
and in a way, Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation, that change, that is happening to all of us.
That's my story. Thanks.
TV executive Lauren Zalaznick thinks deeply about pop television. Sharing results of a bold study that tracks attitudes against TV ratings over five decades, she makes a case that television reflects who we truly are -- in ways we might not have expected.
I want to say that really and truly, after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread, I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television.
So most everyone watches TV.
We like it. We like some parts of it.
Here in America, people actually love TV.
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day.
Okay?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television, so for me, that's a good thing.
But a lot of people don't love it so much.
They, in fact, berate it.
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me.
My mother, growing up, she called it the "idiot box."
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience.
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral, political, social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system.
So all these things are uniquely human, and they all add up to our idea of conscience.
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
We're talking about popular TV.
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years.
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience?
How does television evolve over time, and what does this say about our society?
Now speaking of evolution, from basic biology, you probably remember that the animal kingdom, including humans, have four basic primal instincts.
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.
As humans, what's important to remember is that we've developed, we've evolved over time to temper, or tame, these basic animal instincts.
We have the capacity to laugh and cry.
We feel awe, we feel pity.
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom.
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained.
We love to watch TV.
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom.
Animals might love to play, but they don't love to watch.
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious.
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders.
Is television literally functioning as our conscience, tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?
So to begin to answer these questions, we did a research study.
We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season.
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows.
We talked to over 3,000 individuals -- almost 3,600 -- aged 18 to 70, and we asked them how they felt emotionally.
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?
Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?
What did this mean for you?
So to our global TED audiences, I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.
But as you can see, these emotional need states are truly universal.
And on a factual basis, over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world.
So I really hope our global audiences can relate.
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide: For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis, I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data, I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling, who you may have just seen.
Okay, here we go.
So here you see, from 1960 to 2010, the 50 years of our study.
Two things we're going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state, which, for this purpose, we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me, that make me feel much more positive about the world.
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong.
As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady.
That's what we're watching TV for.
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.
Right at the end of the 60s, moral ambiguity is going up, inspiration is kind of on the wane.
Why?
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot, the Civil Rights movement, race riots, the Vietnam War, MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot, Watergate.
Look what happens.
In 1970, inspiration plummets.
Moral ambiguity takes off.
They cross, but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.
It's trying to recover.
But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years.
Take a look at this.
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green.
Now this time on TV you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke," you have "Andy Griffith," you have domestic shows all about comfort. This is rising. Comfort stays whole.
Irreverence starts to rise.
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
You get to 1969, and look what happens.
You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary, not only battling it out in our society, but you literally have two establishment shows -- "Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" -- in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.
What's number one?
The socially irreverent hippie show, "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."
Viewers had responded dramatically.
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show.
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit, what does that mean?
It means in the 1966 television season, The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say, "My God, I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War, about the presidency, through television?"
That's what we mean by a breakout show.
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.
In 1970, the dam bursts. The dam bursts.
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s.
Now look at this.
The 70s means who? Norman Lear.
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son," and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- "M*A*S*H."
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied, seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence
appeared on air during the Vietnam War, five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.
Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that?
It can make me feel this?
It can change us?
So to this very, very savvy crowd, I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive.
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago.
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute: fantasy and imagination, which are shows defined as, "takes me out of my everyday realm" and "makes me feel better."
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment, which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.
You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise, it maps to a spike in unemployment.
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed?
No. In the 70s you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman" that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973, followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."
Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power.
What were those shows?
Glamorous and rich.
"Dallas," "Fantasy Island." Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts: unemployment.
So here you are, in my favorite chart, because this is our last 20 years.
Whether or not you're in my business, you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV.
Well, as we say in the business, X marks the spot.
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."
Everything's good, low unemployment.
But look: X marks the spot.
In 2001, the September 2001 television season, humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.
Why not?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court.
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.
We had 9/11.
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.
Look what happens when we keep going.
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off, reality television has taken hold.
What do people want in their TV then?
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia.
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.
No, they want judgment.
I can vote you off the island.
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.
That's all great, right?
So as dramatically different as these television shows, pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with? --
one basic instinct remains.
We're animals, we need our moms.
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive, dominant TV mom.
The 1950s: June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."
Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.
Maude Findlay, the epitome of the irreverent 1970s, who tackled abortion, divorce, even menopause on TV.
The 1980s, our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington.
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood.
This era's mom, Bree Van de Kamp.
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience, sitting on television's shoulders, but I do know that I absolutely love this image.
So to you all, the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen, the global audiences of TEDWomen, thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television.
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television.
They give it life on television, for sure, but it's you as viewers, through your collective social consciences, that give it life, longevity, power or not.
So thanks very much.
Psychologist Jonathan Haidt asks a simple, but difficult question: why do we search for self-transcendence? Why do we attempt to lose ourselves? In a tour through the science of evolution by group selection, he proposes a provocative answer.
I have a question for you: Are you religious?
Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person.
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
Okay, here's another question: Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
Okay, that's the majority.
My Talk today is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons, why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
My Talk today is about self-transcendence.
It's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
And when that happens, the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings.
We talk about being uplifted or elevated.
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor.
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we're very familiar with.
But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase.
We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness.
In 1902, the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
He collected all kinds of case studies.
He quoted the words of all kinds of people who'd had a variety of these experiences.
One of the most exciting to me is this young man, Stephen Bradley, had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
And here's what Bradley said about it.
Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to me, "Come."
The next day I rejoiced with trembling.
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
This world had no place in my affections.
Previous to this time, I was very selfish and self-righteous.
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could, with a feeling heart, forgive my worst enemies.
JH: So note how Bradley's petty, moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase.
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving.
The world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase.
Some shut down the self using meditation.
Others use psychedelic drugs.
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
Others use dancing, spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence.
But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.
Others overcome their self at raves.
But here's the weirdest place of all: war.
So many books about war say the same thing, that nothing brings people together like war.
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
I'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray.
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle.
Here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase.
Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.
"I" passes insensibly into a "we," "my" becomes "our" and individual faith loses its central importance.
I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy.
I may fall, but I do not die, for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life.
JH: So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away, and it feels good, it feels really good, in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
It feels somehow uplifting.
This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex, or two-level man.
The lower level he called the level of the profane.
Now profane is the opposite of sacred.
It just means ordinary or common.
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
We want to satisfy our individual desires.
We pursue our individual goals.
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change.
Individuals unite into a team, a movement or a nation, which is far more than the sum of its parts.
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group, into a moral community.
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness.
And once people circle around some sacred object or value, they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum, of making a group out of individuals.
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended.
Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square, which brought down a dictator.
And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt, that brought us all together, after 9/11.
So let me summarize where we are.
I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human.
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind.
I'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred.
When we climb that staircase, self-interest fades away, we become just much less self-interested, and we feel as though we are better, nobler and somehow uplifted.
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me: Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design?
Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands?
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience, it's just a mistake?
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.
The New Atheists, for example, argue that religion is a set of memes, sort of parasitic memes, that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff, self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.
And after all, how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves?
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest?
Well let me show you.
In "The Descent of Man," Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from, why do we have it.
Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves, but they're of great use to our groups.
He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition.
He said, "If the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other."
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected."
In other words, Charles Darwin believed in group selection.
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years, but it's about to make a major comeback this year, especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April, making a very strong case that we, and several other species, are products of group selection.
But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection.
So look at it this way: You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.
So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.
Within this team there's competition.
There are guys competing with each other.
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
So within the team, their interests are actually pitted against each other.
And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys.
Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach.
But while that competition is going on within the boat, this competition is going on across boats.
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat, now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat.
They can only win if they all pull together as a team.
I mean, these things sound trite, but they are deep evolutionary truths.
The main argument against group selection has always been that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators, but as soon as you have a group of cooperators, they're just going to get taken over by free-riders, individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
Let me illustrate this for you.
Suppose we've got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what -- and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other, they work together, they generate wealth.
And as you'll see in this simulation, as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow, and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split, and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.
But suppose then that one of them mutates.
There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
It takes advantage of the others.
And so when a green interacts with a blue, you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
So here's how things play out.
We start with just one green, and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food.
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
The free-riders have taken over.
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started.
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
It's not that hard a problem.
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
And nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat.
For example, why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA, totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
It's because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism.
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them, they were all in the same membrane, now all the wealth-created division of labor, all the greatness created by cooperation, stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism.
And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms.
What I've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history.
Darwin's laws don't change, but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different.
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria.
It happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple, primitive nests, or hives.
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive, they had no choice but to cooperate, because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives.
And the most cohesive hives won, just as Darwin said.
These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere.
And it happened again, even more spectacularly, in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures, they came together around a hearth or a campfire, they divided labor, they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects, and eventually they worshiped their own gods.
Once they were all in the same tribe, they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet, which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction.
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives.
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart.
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
In fact, often, as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts, often those divisions are along religious lines.
Nonetheless, when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement, they can move mountains.
Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.
Do you think they're there pursuing their self-interest?
Or are they pursuing communal interest, which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole?
Okay, so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way.
And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way.
Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties of religious experience, as William James explained.
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves.
The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred, or deeply interconnected.
We are Homo duplex, as Durkheim explained.
And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection, as Darwin explained.
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug, but if it is an adaptation, then the implications are profound.
If it is an adaptation, then we evolved to be religious.
I don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions.
Those things came along too recently.
I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects, people and ideas.
This is why politics is so tribal.
Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest, but politics is also about sacredness.
It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas.
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil, and we all believe we're on the good team.
And most importantly, if the staircase is real, it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life.
Because human beings are, to some extent, hivish creatures like bees.
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed.
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort.
Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom.
But sometimes we wonder: Is this all there is?
What should I do with my life?
What's missing?
What's missing is that we are Homo duplex, but modern, secular society was built to satisfy our lower, profane selves.
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.
Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top.
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.
They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into.
They're all searching for their staircase.
And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish.
Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger.
And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago.
"No man is an island entire of itself.
Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."
JH: Thank you.
Author Sam Martin shares photos of a quirky world hobby that's trending with the XY set: "manspaces." Grab a cold one and enjoy.
So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves,
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren.
When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space.
My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half.
And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.
So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own.
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,
and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space.
It had everything I needed. It was quiet.
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
As I was building this space, I thought to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own."
So I did some research.
And I found that there was an historic precedence.
Hemingway had his writing space.
Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,
and there was, of course, the Batcave.
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now.
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from.
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
But on the inside, it's anything but.
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important.
I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.
And he found the scoreboard in the trash.
Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.
This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir. The guy did it all himself.
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.
So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
There were definitely hang-out spots. But some were for working, some were for playing,
some were for guys to collect their things.
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
Take this place for example.
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
This is in Long Island, New York.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style.
It has no nails or screws.
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.
Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.
But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.
And so there is a good reason for this.
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics,
and he trains in this space. He trains other people.
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,
which is another sort of important part about a manspace.
So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion.
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s. Museum quality.
So, as I came to the end of my journey,
I found over 50 spaces. And they were unexpected and they were surprising.
But they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them.
And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did.
And they really loved their professions.
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were.
So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
Thank you very much.
Great design is a never-ending journey of discovery -- for which it helps to pack a healthy sense of humor. Sociologist and surfer-turned-designer David Carson walks through a gorgeous slide deck of his work and found images.
I had requested slides, kind of adamantly, up till the -- pretty much, last few days, but was denied access to a slide projector. I actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal, and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work, unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
Now, I agree that you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions and, you know, if you use a slide projector, you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side, or up or down, but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off, to trade that off for a focus.
It's a thought. Just a thought.
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.
And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up, which we won't see tonight. So.
With that, let's get the first slide up here. This, as many of you have probably guessed, is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal.
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time, and I thought -- you know, fly all night, I looked up, and I thought, wow, how clean.
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
I mean, how nice is that?
Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture.
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
Till a couple months later, I went back to the same airport -- same plane, I think -- and looked up, and it said C.
It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into.
I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.
That area of design interests me the most, and I think this for me is a real clear, very simplified version of what I'm talking about.
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical, situated next to each other.
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
You know, it's pretty clear.
Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message.
O.K., which one would you park in front of?
Same color, same message, same words.
The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece -- and, again, which is the psycho-killer here?
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
I would probably park in front of the other one.
I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so.
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign, and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist.
And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
This is for a book by "Metropolis."
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it.
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention, getting you to look over that way.
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.
This is from my second book.
The first book is called, "The End of Print," and it was done along with a film, working with William Burroughs.
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it, he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it.
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says, "I remember attending an exhibition called, 'Photography: The End of Painting.'" And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
So, apparently when photography was perfected, there were people going around saying, that's it: you've just ruined painting.
People are just going to take pictures now.
And of course, that wasn't the case.
So, this is from "2nd Sight," a book I did on intuition.
I think it's not the only ingredient in design, but possibly the most important.
It's something everybody has.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
So it tends to get discounted.
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says, "The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
And the more you try to think about it, the further the answer gets from you, and the minute you stop thinking about it, your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
I like this for a couple of reasons.
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this. I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
So, what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material?
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.
This is working with Marshall McLuhan.
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric, and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times, predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising, television, media world.
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before, and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
So, this was the contents page originally.
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever, but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
So, a couple spreads from the book: here McLuhan says, "The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
"The invention of printing did away with anonymity, fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,"
which had never been done before printing. "When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies, anxieties of all kinds result."
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world, they always form vivid images of the preceding world."
I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering."
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden, and it was done right after 9/11.
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by, and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
I was, O.K.; that's fine.
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing, and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal, and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD, and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape, and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver, where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
So, this is a six-shot sequence.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
And then the tiny line of copy says, If you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website.
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture.
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment -- asked me to do these posters.
They were wild-posted around New York City.
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But -- -- but I did.
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night, and there were definitely some heads turning, you know, people smoking and, "Huh!"
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something; it looked like they might be real. Anyway.
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas, and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
This was either an old product with new packaging, or a brand-new package, and I just thought, Yikes! How's that still happening?
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really, and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night, and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.
It was a worldwide branding campaign.
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
They thought some people didn't like them.
I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide.
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit, and what I did was add type and people to the ad, which the previous campaign had not had, and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.
And we were trying to say that, hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK; some of them actually have friends and family, and they're not all awful people.
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday." So, we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative: their over-competitiveness, their, you know, long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it.
You know: Thank God it's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls, and hear everybody else's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home.
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with, because they were all elaborately art-directed, and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
And this is how the ad ran around the world.
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference.
This is how the ad ran throughout the world; Germany made one slight change in the ad.
Now, there's kind of two issues here.
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...
And then as the agency explained to me, they said, "Look, we don't have little green people in our country; why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;
I think it's a very small-minded approach, the world is certainly much more global, and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer, though we'll never know.
This is some work from Ray Gun.
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles, listen to the music, and try to interpret it.
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
This is an opener for Brian Eno, and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat.
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
Having done a lot of magazines, I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories, and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times, which was basically the moment of impact.
And People magazine, I thought, got probably the best shot.
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting: there was something more enticing, if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek.
But when I got into this magazine, there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
Look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she's going through? -- and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's -- unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
And this continued through the entire magazine.
It did not let up.
This says: "One clean fits all." .
There were a lot of orphans made this day, and here's a dead body being brought out.
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate.
And this one I think is possibly the worst: two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
One -- who knows what she's going through; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
And -- I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this, and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk, and when they got back to their car, they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event -- it had been a few months.
This was what they found on their car.
There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car, but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
This is my desktop.
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders, but I don't know what they are.
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.
We are wrapping up.
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea, because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer, you can now get a plate in the keyboard, so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway. Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...
I'm just not sure this is improvement.
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design, this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion, of graphic design, even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.
What's next? What's next is going to be people.
As we get more technically driven, the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
You have to utilize who you are in your work.
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background, from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work, and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way, and I thought this was a great example of both.
This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
But more importantly, she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
And I'm thinking, yeah, right, I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles, and you get charged by this thing and you go, oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father, who was a test pilot, and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot, they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job.
That's pretty high for most occupations.
But, you know, the government would make a plane; they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
Some of them did; some of them didn't.
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between, like, serif versus san-serif.
And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?
Why not put some of yourself into the work?
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students, What's the definition of a good job?
And as teachers, after you get all the answers, you like to give them the correct answer.
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is: If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue -- would you be doing that same work?
And if you would, you've got a great job.
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
You're going to be dead a really long time.
Thank you very much.
Tech enthusiast Kevin Kelly asks "What does technology want?" and discovers that its movement toward ubiquity and complexity is much like the evolution of life.
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life.
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology. So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature, as it relates to the spiritual.
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --
he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
But I was interested in another definition of technology.
Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases?
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say, to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
And I'm applying a similar trick to say, what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it.
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
And I think once we ask that question we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously, if we keep extending the origins of technology far back, I think we come back to life at some point.
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
And like you heard from the previous speakers, we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
We have really no idea.
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth.
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species.
This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet.
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen from Jamie and others, these magnificent things -- what they're doing, each one of them, is they're hacking the rules of life.
I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon, and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus, six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants, the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
But a more interesting way, the current way to take the long view, is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here.
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking, and has a different way of finding out how to do life.
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life.
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized.
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
Like those chloroplast cells -- they're completely surrounded by other life.
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology? And again, my question is, what does technology want? And so, remarkably, I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization.
That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time.
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter, and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household.
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII, had only about 7,000 items in his household.
And he was the King of England, and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life.
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say, I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
And so it would be sort of approximately up there, coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that, we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails, and to do a morphological analysis, and try to derive their genealogical history over time.
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said, "Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?
They're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button -- -- for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said, how many of these things are still being made? And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
And the answer is: all of them.
All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
I don't know who needs a corn sheller.
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are -- you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now, brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens.
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability.
So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking, the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
That is what we call an "infinite game."
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
The origins of technology was not in 1829, but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang, and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot, and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
That's the definition. There was no temperature.
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference.
So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
Those are all basically the same thing.
And those are the things that technology brings us.
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
And that's why we continue to grab technology -- because we want those things. Those things are good.
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones.
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be.
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints.
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference.
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
That's what technology really wants.
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation. I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields, but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
Our humanity is actually defined by technology.
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
That's what we're talking about.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
That's what technology wants.
And so when I think about what technology wants, I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this -- every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
That recursive nature is the infinite game.
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.
Thank you.
Underwater filmmaker Mike deGruy has spent decades looking intimately at the ocean. A consummate storyteller, he takes the stage at Mission Blue to share his awe and excitement -- and his fears -- about the blue heart of our planet.
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --
somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers, forming this beautiful delta.
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes, birds of every flavor.
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six.
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors, just pulsing all of these colors. And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it, raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him, so I put him down.
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:
It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh! -- vanished right before my eyes.
And I knew, right then, at age six, that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology, and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii.
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at, but they didn't really interact with people.
But the octopus did.
If you walked up to an octopus tank, especially early in the morning before anyone arrived, the octopus would rise up and look at you and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!" And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities:
Some of them would hold their ground,
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,
and one in particular, this amazing animal ... I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.
So I went right up to the front of the tank --
I was three or four inches from the front glass --
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock, and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone. Anyway, there we were, staring at each other, and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system, and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race, because I was out and he had six left.
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing, which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
So, about three years into my degree, a funny thing happened on the way to the office, which actually changed the course of my life.
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him, and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition." "OK, a couple of biologists making a movie -- this'll be interesting,"
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie, which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making,
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head, thinking, "Wait a minute.
Maybe I can do this all the time.
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker." So I literally came back from that job, quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
It's been a good ride.
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.
If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals, especially behavior, it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are, how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.
But where I really learned about octopus was in the field, as a filmmaker making films with them, where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes.
I remember I took a trip to Australia, went to an island called One Tree Island.
And apparently, evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,
between the time they named it and the time I arrived, because I'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there.
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef.
In fact, there's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly. And there's a beautiful reef, very complex reef, with lots of animals, including a lot of octopus.
And not uniquely but certainly, the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage.
As a matter of fact, there's one right there.
So our first challenge was to find these things, and that was a challenge, indeed.
But the idea is, we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.
So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could, every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.
And after the first week, they ignored us.
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me." So they went on about their business
and from a foot away, we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience.
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember, or at least visually, was a foraging behavior.
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging,
but this particular one used vision.
And they would see a coral head, maybe 10 feet away, and start moving over toward that coral head.
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be, but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head, and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head, and they would fish out, swim for crabs.
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.
And I always wondered what happened under that web.
So we created a way to find out,
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
It was fantastic.
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals, you might as well pick one that's fairly common.
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.
They also live deep.
And I can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep, but whatever the case, I like that.
It's like nothing you've ever done.
If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen, and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen, get in a sub.
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen, turn on the scrubber, which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio.
And as you go down, the washing machine at the surface calms down.
And it gets quiet.
And it starts getting really nice.
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue.
And finally, it's a rich lavender, and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.
And now you've entered the realm of the mid-water community.
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water.
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned, without question, the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.
But we're just going to zip right past this area, this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range, 40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall, some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface, creating islands like Hawaii.
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range.
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart, magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,
and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes.
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure, forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth, until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals, reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
In fact, this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
So it immediately cools, and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved, and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.
And it forms these towers, these chimneys that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.
You've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long.
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes.
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals: shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab, clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until 33 years ago.
And it completely threw science on its head.
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun.
And before the discovery of these vents, all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth, was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis. But down there, there is no sun, there is no photosynthesis;
it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it, and it's all so ephemeral.
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent, which you think at the time has to be on another planet.
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;
it looks like aliens in an alien environment.
But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead.
There's no hot water.
All of the animals are gone, they're dead,
and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town, an eerie, spooky ghost town, but essentially devoid of animals, of course.
But 10 miles down the ridge... pshhh! There's another volcano going.
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge.
And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn't really different from some of the areas that I've seen in 35 years of traveling around, making films.
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.
And you go back, and I'm at home, and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods." And you show up, and it's dead.
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
You think, "Well, what happened?" And you turn around, and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in, and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.
And over here there's a golf course going in.
And this is the tropics.
It's raining like crazy here.
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside, carrying with it sediments from the construction site, smothering the coral and killing it.
And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course --
the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals, fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --
and there's your pea soup.
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island.
Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?" Well, how it happened is the local community galvanized.
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay, and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay, and the bay recovered.
The ocean has an amazing ability to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.
I think Margaret Mead said it best.
She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world.
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay.
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.
I've been to a lot of lectures where, at the end of it, inevitably, one of the first questions that comes up is, "But, but what can I do?
I'm an individual. I'm one person.
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming." Fair enough question.
My answer to that is don't look at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.
Look in your own backyard.
Look in your heart, actually.
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?
And fix it.
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same.
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map, little dots on a map.
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today -- where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China, and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ... and everybody is talking to everyone else --
it's not isolated points on a map anymore, it's a network we've created.
And maybe these healing zones can start growing, and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.
So that's how I answer that question.
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
What can you do that is more responsible than what you're doing now?
And do that, and spread the word.
The vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live, but up here we can.
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment, like those people changed the health of that bay.
Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could, everything we could, to set aside not pin pricks, but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation, "hope spots," she calls them.
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots" can be in the deep ocean, an area that has historically been seriously neglected, if not abused. The term "deep six" comes to mind:
"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill, deep six it!"
So, I hope that we can also keep some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.
Now, I don't get a wish, but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle's wish.
And that I do.
Thank you very much.
New Yorker cartoonist Liza Donnelly shares a portfolio of her wise and funny cartoons about modern life -- and talks about how humor can empower women to change the rules.
I was afraid of womanhood.
Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend.
I've learned to be flexible.
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear.
Let me explain.
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft,
and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy --
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
There were plenty of role models all around us.
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be.
Now my mother was different.
She was a homemaker, but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,
and she didn't buy me pink outfits.
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
And I just ate it up.
I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak -- I was very shy -- and I could still get approval.
I was launched as a cartoonist.
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is.
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
We're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave.
Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture.
We're being corrected,
and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition.
We pass it down from generation to generation.
Not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us.
And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing.
We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh.
Now what if you put together women and humor?
I think you can get change.
Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table.
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos.
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,
and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on.
And then also my family was in chaos,
and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter.
It didn't work.
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
But I found my place.
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in.
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning.
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning," and so I did. I became a cartoonist.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something?
I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?" Now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
I can't help it. I live here.
Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman.
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S.
Consequently, we have. Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae.
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy,
and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties.
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances.
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents.
And I think, I truly believe, that we can change this thing one laugh at a time.
Thank you.
Physicist Geoffrey West has found that simple, mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth, crime rate, walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number: the city's population. In this mind-bending talk from TEDGlobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations.
Cities are the crucible of civilization.
They have been expanding, urbanization has been expanding, at an exponential rate in the last 200 years so that by the second part of this century, the planet will be completely dominated by cities.
Cities are the origins of global warming, impact on the environment, health, pollution, disease, finance, economies, energy -- they're all problems that are confronted by having cities.
That's where all these problems come from.
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet.
Here's some numbers.
Two hundred years ago, the United States was less than a few percent urbanized.
It's now more than 82 percent.
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
China's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years.
Now listen to this: Every week for the foreseeable future, until 2050, every week more than a million people are being added to our cities.
This is going to affect everything.
Everybody in this room, if you stay alive, is going to be affected by what's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon.
However, cities, despite having this negative aspect to them, are also the solution.
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people, creating ideas, innovation, wealth and so on.
So we have this kind of dual nature.
And so there's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities.
Now these are my comrades in arms.
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people, and they've done all the work, and I'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together.
So here's the problem: This is what we all want.
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this, having things like this, doing things like this, with economies that are growing like this, not realizing that entropy produces things like this, this, this and this.
And the question is: Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York are going to look like in 2050, or is it going to be this?
That's the question.
I must say, many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like, but let's talk about it.
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.
And scientific theory means quantifiable -- relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework.
That's the quest.
Is that conceivable?
Are there universal laws?
So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem.
The first is: Are cities part of biology?
Is London a great big whale?
Is Edinburgh a horse?
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?
What do we learn from that?
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --
is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit, or is there serious substance to it?
And if that is the case, how come that it's very hard to kill a city?
You could drop an atom bomb on a city, and 30 years later it's surviving.
Very few cities fail.
All companies die, all companies.
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust.
So is that just another version of this?
Well we understand this very well.
That is, you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size, how many branches of a given size does a tree have, how many leaves, what is the energy flowing through each branch, what is the size of the canopy, what is its growth, what is its mortality?
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions.
And the idea is can we do the same for this?
So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life, is that it is scalable, it works over an extraordinary range.
This is just a tiny range actually: It's us mammals; we're one of these.
The same principles, the same dynamics, the same organization is at work in all of these, including us, and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
And that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust -- scalability.
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.
But you know, at a local level, you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.
That's called growth. Here's how you grew.
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.
We're all pretty much the same.
And you see, you're very familiar with this.
You grow very quickly and then you stop.
And that line there is a prediction from the same theory, based on the same principles, that describes that forest.
And here it is for the growth of a rat,
and those points on there are data points.
This is just the weight versus the age.
And you see, it stops growing.
Very, very good for biology -- also one of the reasons for its great resilience.
Very, very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm.
This is what we believe.
This is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us, particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner: hockey sticks.
This is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away, and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.
Okay, so how do we understand this?
So let's first talk about biology.
This is explicitly showing you how things scale,
and this is a truly remarkable graph.
What is plotted here is metabolic rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight, your mass, for all of us bunch of organisms.
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10, otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.
And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line.
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe, there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this.
It's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms, each subsystem, each cell type, each gene, has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history.
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection, they've been constrained to lie on a line.
Something else is going on.
Before I talk about that, I've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve, this straight line.
It's three-quarters, roughly, which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.
And here's the point of that.
It says that, if it were linear, the steepest slope, then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy.
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into is that, if you double the size of the organism, you actually only need 75 percent more energy.
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.
The bigger you are systematically, according to very well-defined rules, less energy per capita.
Now any physiological variable you can think of, any life history event you can think of, if you plot it this way, looks like this.
There is an extraordinary regularity.
So you tell me the size of a mammal, I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology, life history, etc.
And the reason for this is because of networks.
All of life is controlled by networks -- from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level.
And you're very familiar with these networks.
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.
If you take those networks, this idea of networks, and you apply universal principles, mathematizable, universal principles, all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow, including the description of the forest, the description of your circulatory system, the description within cells.
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that, systematically, the pace of life decreases as you get bigger.
Heart rates are slower; you live longer; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower, etc.
The question is: Is any of this true for cities and companies?
So is London a scaled up Birmingham, which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco, which is a scaled up Santa Fe?
Don't know. We will discuss that.
But they are networks,
and the most important network of cities is you.
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, our interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals.
Here's just a symbolic picture of that.
And here's scaling of cities.
This shows that in this very simple example, which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing.
There is a scaling.
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size.
The slope of that is less than linear.
There is an economy of scale.
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.
But here's what's surprising.
It scales in the same way everywhere.
This is just European countries, but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia, always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree.
And any infrastructure you look at -- whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.
It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.
But even more surprising is if you look at socio-economic quantities, quantities that have no analog in biology, that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10,000 years ago.
The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way.
And the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way.
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon.
But most important in this, the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate, is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
Here it is, which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita, unlike biology -- higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger, more patents per capita, more crime per capita.
And we've looked at everything: more AIDS cases, flu, etc.
And here, they're all plotted together.
Just to show you what we plotted, here is income, GDP -- GDP of the city -- crime and patents all on one graph.
And you can see, they all follow the same line.
And here's the statement.
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000, from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million, it doesn't matter, then systematically you get a 15 percent increase in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases, number of police, anything you can think of.
It goes up by 15 percent,
and you have a 15 percent savings on the infrastructure.
This, no doubt, is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities.
Because they think that all those wonderful things -- like creative people, wealth, income -- is what attracts them, forgetting about the ugly and the bad.
What is the reason for this?
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics, but underlying this is the social networks,
because this is a universal phenomenon.
This 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- Japan, Chile, Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.
Always, all the data shows it's the same, despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
Something universal is going on.
The universality, to repeat, is us -- that we are the city.
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.
So there it is, I've said it again.
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure, unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling, economies of scale, you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger.
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life.
The bigger you are, life gets faster.
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.
On the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of European cities, showing that increase.
Lastly, I want to talk about growth.
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.
Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.
You grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience.
That would be bad for economies and cities.
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation, then indeed you get, from the same theory, a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.
And in fact, if you compare it to data, it fits very well with the development of cities and economies.
But it has a terrible catch,
and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse.
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.
What we do is, as we grow and we approach the collapse, a major innovation takes place and we start over again,
and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.
The catch, however, to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster.
So the image is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster, but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings, avoid a heart attack?
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies.
See companies, they scale.
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.
It's the same plot.
This happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.
We could use sales, anything you like.
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning, when companies are innovating, they scale beautifully.
And we've looked at 23,000 companies in the United States, may I say.
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
What is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology, indicating that they're dominated, not by super-linear innovation and ideas; they become dominated by economies of scale.
In that interpretation, by bureaucracy and administration, and they do it beautifully, may I say.
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company, I could have predicted the size of Walmart.
If it has this sublinear scaling, the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth.
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.
That's what we like, hockey sticks.
But you notice, I've cheated, because I've only gone up to '94.
Let's go up to 2008.
That red line is from the theory.
So if I'd have done this in 1994, I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies.
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.
They all start looking like hockey sticks, they all bend over, and they all die like you and me.
Thank you.
Diana Laufenberg shares 3 surprising things she has learned about teaching -- including a key insight about learning from mistakes.
I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned.
Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world.
When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome.
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level.
But the information was closer to me.
I could get access to it.
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet.
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government.
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government, loved the political system.
Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system.
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves.
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They produced fliers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning.
The older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went, "Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
"She doesn't know what she's in for."
But I knew that the kids would show up,
and I believed it,
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
And that night, all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
I had to just sit and watch.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
It meant something to them.
And they will step up.
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
Again, "thrilled" to learn.
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school,
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it.
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive.
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
It's the first time we'd done this.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share.
The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people?
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary.
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia.
We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information.
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process.
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning.
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong.
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn.
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure.
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill.
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And they had certain criteria to do it.
They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
They can talk -- they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them.
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
Go create. Go figure it out.
Let's see what we can do.
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is." And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And I said, "Go read it."
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves,
and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time,
because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process.
There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
Ask them really interesting questions.
They will not disappoint.
Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark.
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better.
Alan Russell studies regenerative medicine -- a breakthrough way of thinking about disease and injury, using a process that can signal the body to rebuild itself.
I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope.
When we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in, there are words that we just don't want to hear.
There are words that we're truly afraid of.
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart failure, lung failure --
things that we know are debilitating diseases, for which there's relatively little that can be done.
And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease, why it's important,
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't,
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow, and what some of the hurdles are.
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
I want to start with this slide, because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale.
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
This is not regenerative medicine.
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I'll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
So that at the end of the treatment, you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel.
And this is just the same.
If you look back in history, Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes, was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller, to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
And they published this book in 1937, where they actually began to think about, what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
We've come a long way since then.
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
But before doing that, what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you.
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older.
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
And you can basically see that the richer a country is, the older the people are within it.
Why is this important?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
If the average age of your population is 30, then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again, maybe a little bit of asthma.
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55, now the average person is looking at diabetes, early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --
things that are inherently more difficult to treat, and much more expensive to treat.
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
This is from "The Untied States of America."
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick, paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this?
This is age versus cost of health care.
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45, there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies, you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care, plotted over your lifetime.
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
And you can actually -- -- we won't get into that.
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging.
I'd suggest there are four things,
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
All those things do is change who pays.
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
You can prevent.
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease, perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it, but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
This is a newt re-growing its limb.
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment.
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body, for tissues and for organs themselves.
So today's reality is that if we get sick, the message is we will treat your symptoms, and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate, but it's within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
There's a limb prosthetic up here, similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually face the regeneration of that limb.
It's a wild concept.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
How can we do that?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
We need to learn to speak the body's language.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy, will re-grow that limb.
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
It's a natural process, but it is lost as we age.
In a child, before the age of about six months, if they lose their fingertip in an accident, they'll re-grow their fingertip.
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
So to engage in that conversation with the body, we need to speak the body's language.
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body.
The first is cellular therapies.
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process, using cells to do most of the work.
Therefore, if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
Secondly, we can use materials.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself.
And he asked a very important question.
He asked the question, if I take that material, which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine, and I place it somewhere else on a person's body, would it give a tissue-specific response, or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
The picture I'm about to show you
However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet, check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
This is the reality of diabetes.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers, we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment, which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
The treatment for this is amputation.
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer, that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
That material contained only natural signals.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before.
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I'll let you know when you can look again.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident.
Just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel, and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up.
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds.
Could you regenerate a limb?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question.
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
After treatment that's what it looks like.
This is happening today.
This is clinically relevant today.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
But could you go a little further?
Could you, say, instead of using material, can I take some cells along with the material, and remove a damaged piece of tissue, put a bio-degradable material on there?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
He chills the dish, it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish.
It's the coolest stuff.
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference.
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation, you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
And if you look really carefully, it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush.
You see the cells coming back out.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices, to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
This was a randomized trial.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass, for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
These are now two years out.
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early, and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively, with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
There go the cells.
We don't have time to go into all of those details, but basically, that works too.
You can take patients who are less sick, and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy.
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet, but I think very soon will be.
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh, along with a number of colleagues around the world.
They've decided that liposuction fluid, which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
It's a great source of stem cells.
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
Out comes the liposuction fluid, and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
All done in the lab.
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease.
Here's just one example before I close up.
This is equally tragic.
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army, who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
Many of those patients are very severely burned.
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn, it's that we don't know how to treat it.
Everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach.
We make something over here, and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound, and we try and get the two to take.
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR -- by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
The gun that you see there sprays cells.
That's going to spray cells over that area.
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment, deliver other things as well at the same time, and therefore we will seed that lawn, as opposed to try the sodding approach.
It's a completely different way of doing it.
So my 18 minutes is up.
So let me finish up with some good news, and maybe a little bit of bad news.
The good news is that this is happening today.
It's very powerful work.
Clearly the images kind of get that across.
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen.
A number of governments, and a number of regions, have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
The Japanese government were perhaps the first, when they decided to invest first 3 billion, later another 2 billion in this field.
It's no coincidence.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
The European Union, same thing.
China, the same thing. China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach. Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
We've had a different approach.
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot, at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago, to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients.
And at the end of a very testy meeting, what the NIH director said was, "Your vision is larger than our appetite."
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision, but together we can change his appetite.
Thank you.
In this hilariously lively performance, actress Sarah Jones channels an opinionated elderly Jewish woman, a fast-talking Dominican college student and more, giving TED2009 just a sample of her spectacular character range.
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here, I thought to myself that well, it's TED.
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that?
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent might help things a bit.
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because, after all, this is the great unveiling.
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens, New York.
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of, you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits, unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
But then what?
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows, allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.
And well, they're very excited.
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.
Oh, wonderful.
Good evening everybody.
Thank you so very much for having me here today.
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
Oh my! There's so many of you.
Hi sweetheart. Okay.
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
She's a very nice, young black girl.
Well you know, she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
But anyway. She has me here because she puts me in her show, what she calls her one-woman show.
And you know what that means, of course.
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
But I don't mind.
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Really, it's amazing.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities.
There are so many celebrities running around here.
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
Isn't that adorable?
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
You know, she's only half Jewish.
Did you know that about her?
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent.
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
Yeah, she's lovely.
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --
you're all so young.
You know, your parents must be very proud.
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
It's like a rainbow.
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
What are you allowed to say or not say?
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
But anyway, you know, I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
You know, it's heartening to me.
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying, absolutely horrifying.
It's true. It's true.
You know, between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know, the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
Anyway.
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess.
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
Thank you for all that you do.
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
So, happy continued success.
Congratulations. Mazel tov.
Hi. Hi.
Thank you everybody.
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
My name is Noraida. And I'm just -- I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that.
I am Dominican-American.
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic, otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here, but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
And I think he's Mexican, so that's -- honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So -- I just -- I'm sorry.
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything.
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me, as you can imagine.
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from, that this even exists.
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like, you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know, which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
I like that.
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization, which is like a leadership thing,
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
And the organization is called DA BOMB, A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym -- Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long, but with the war on terror and everything, the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
So, basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me.
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.
Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --
that's my new title.
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me, like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that, it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
So, I think all people, we need that, but especially, I look at people like me, you know like, I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing, making the talks available online.
That's very good. I love that.
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
Thank you very much.
So, that was Noraida, and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today, these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:
friends, neighbors, family members.
I come from a multicultural family.
In fact, the older lady you just met: very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
It's a long story, believe me.
But on top of my family background, my parents also sent me to the United Nations school, where I encountered a plethora of new characters, including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
It was like, you know, she was there in the class, you know, she was kind of typically French.
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know, talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate.
But [German].
Yes, I took German for three years, [German], and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class, even in the UN school.
Although, you know, it was wonderful.
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
Never. He always, always treated each of us, you know, equally unbearably during the class.
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends, classmates from everywhere,
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.
And they've inspired many characters as well.
For example, a friend of mine.
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
But, you know, I am originally from India, and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California, originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.
So, you can just imagine -- right.
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but -- I'm trying to behave myself,
it's my first time here.
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize, if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
Uh, well, thank you.
Good evening.
My name is Pauline Ning, and first I want to tell you that I'm -- of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED, I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know -- before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people, much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, I try anyway.
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that, she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
But my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly.
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them, and they would always answer me back in English.
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
But when they got older, when the time comes for them to start think about getting married, that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
But that's where we had some problems.
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
But I think he will change his mind soon.
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
But first, she said she's not interested.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
And then at college, it's like she never came home.
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them."
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
I am lesbian."
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear, but from my son, not my daughter.
But at first I did not know what to do.
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
So, even though sometimes it's still hard, I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this, because of ideas like this, and people like you, with an open mind.
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize.
So, for my daughter's sake, I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
Thank you. Xie xie.
Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today.
I am originally from Jordan.
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
It is not Harvard.
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
But I am very proud of my students.
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say, I do like to make the point that we in global society, we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse, which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
So, back in the ancient times.
[Arabic] And this roughly translates: "Please, let me hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles.
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another, there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
Okay? Great.
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you very, very much. I love you.
Well, you have to let me say this.
I just -- thank you.
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home. And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere, but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.
Dr. Seyi Oyesola takes a searing look at health care in underdeveloped countries. His photo tour of a Nigerian teaching hospital -- all low-tech hacks and donated supplies -- drives home the challenge of doing basic health care there.
Just to put everything in context, and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from, so that a lot of the things I'm going to say, and the things I'm going to do -- or things I'm going to tell you I've done -- you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
And by the time I was an intern house officer, I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car -- and I was a paid doctor.
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals, are now, as they say, in diaspora.
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing, where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision.
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map, and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from, the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
Very interesting.
How many people do you think are on that taxi?
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these, and I didn't have a helmet, either.
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country." And she's right. Every time you go there, you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go?
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,
AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things, I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things, or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
You remember all that oil?
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
You can say some of this is education.
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination, malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
In fact, when I start running around saying, "Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S., can you come home with me and do a mission?"
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine. And that's my specialty, right?
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
And believe me, these are current pictures.
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K., that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria,
and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
So, these are the problems.
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?
There we go -- we're going on a mission.
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit, on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons, cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place, but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
So, here we are, mission. Big trouble.
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
Does he look like he's happy?
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, "Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it."
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
Yes, let's just go work this thing out.
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
We get a lot of donated equipment.
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that, so long as we use it and we move on.
But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
So what we going to do now?
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that.
We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them, you email them. But we were still using X-rays, but we didn't even have a viewing box!
And we were doing open-heart surgery.
OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria, but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease, VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
You still get people who believe in it and they came.
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required, would have been treated when she was a child.
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart, but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.
But how many did we do the first one? 12.
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right?
This is what I mean about appropriate technology.
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
Have you seen one of those before?
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:
"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."
Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company. This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them, gives them the tools they need to keep going."
And that's a perfect example of one.
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything, and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do, because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced, does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine: multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car, that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
And guess what, if it all fails, if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables. And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new, and what we will have in a few months, I hope, is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
These are the basic features of my device, or our device.
This is what makes it so special.
Apart from the awards it's won, it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA -- and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S.
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise, size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...
This picture was taken last year.
These are members of my graduating class, 1986.
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac, for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope. And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice. You have to do it. Africans have to do it, in conjunction with everyone else.
Thank you.
Film producer Jeff Skoll talks about his film company, Participant Productions, and the people who've inspired him to do good.
I've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from TED for years.
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call. In 2004, I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year, and no call.
And finally, I get a call last year, and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley, I had some misgivings.
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols. Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
Hollywood gathers around power tables, and the Valley gathers around power tables.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak, he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma, and they want to know what drives you a bit.
And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share.
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days, Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey, I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call "Humanity 2.0."
And it's also something that resides in each of us, to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today.
One is the gap in opportunity -- this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven, unfair and unsustainable -- and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us.
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
And I think that's just a horrible thing.
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us, because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
And if the men and women of TED can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer, except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place.
And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected, that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living, so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent, so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die, but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
But for a young man that made a real impression on me, that one never knows how much time one really has.
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move, which is very well named, because people kept stealing the computers.
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business, so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize for this. This is a photo from the old days.
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me buy and sell things online with each other.
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree, I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."
And needless to say, I was right.
But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world.
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
But for me, personally, it was a real change.
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers, to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
And around that time, I met John Gardner, who is a remarkable man.
He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do, or anyone could do, to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity.
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
Bet on good people doing good things."
And that really resonated with me.
I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things.
These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks, who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems.
People today we call social entrepreneurs.
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus, who started the Grameen Bank, has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world, won the Nobel Peace Prize.
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know. Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa, because she felt girls' education was lagging.
And she started it about 10 years ago, and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale, who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis, also known as black fever.
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease, which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things.
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful.
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,
invest in them. Invest in their organizations,
or in business. Invest in these folks.
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year.
And celebrate them: tell their stories, because not only are there good people doing good work, but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part, that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all.
And a light bulb went off, which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing, what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
And I thought about the films that inspired me, films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
And there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest.
So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement.
One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was, "The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you, who think you're going to come to this town and make movies." And then of course, there was the other adage. "The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business." Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest.
And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change.
And we don't just want people to see our movies and say, that was fun, and forget about it.
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films, "Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana" and "Good Night and Good Luck."
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
Perhaps more importantly, tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies.
And we had an online component of that, our community sect called Participate.net.
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film, there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually kind of a box office disaster.
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment, domestic violence and so on.
And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions, and with our social sector partners, like the National Organization of Women, the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act.
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's -- the film started about a true-life story
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer, led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act, and the Violence Against Women Act and others.
And then the movie about this person doing these things, then led to this greater renewal.
And so again, it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al -- I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of 2005.
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
And after we saw his slide show, it became clear that it was much more urgent.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film, because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world, speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood, that nobody knows nothing about anything.
And I really thought this was going to be a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest, and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland, and most of Scandinavia.
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S. and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
And for Participant, this is just the start.
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
And we have 10 films in production right now, and dozens others in development.
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner," based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
And we think once people see these films, they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
and the Middle East in general. We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968, Abby Hoffman and crew,
and, again, a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world.
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour, which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial -- -- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way.
And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives, or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change.
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person, or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person, but every one of us is all of those things and more.
And I believe if we do these things, we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
And I can imagine, if we do this, the headlines in 10 years might read something like these: "New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero," "U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" -- -- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence." And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show, now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
And I believe that, working together, we can make all of these things happen.
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.
It's been a real honor. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
For the last eight years, pop singer Annie Lennox has devoted the majority of her time to her SING campaign, raising awareness and money to combat HIV/AIDS. She shares the experiences that have inspired her, from working with Nelson Mandela to meeting a little African girl in a desperate situation.
I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV/AIDS campaigner.
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation --
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life.
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.
You can see the bars of the window there.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children.
This was a huge impact on my mind,
because I am a woman and I am a mother, and I hadn't realized that the HIV/AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way.
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa, when I left Capetown, I told myself, "This is going to be something that I have to talk about.
I have to serve." And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done.
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,
everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa, his country, the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus?
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there, they would be shocked.
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat, the founder of Treatment Action Campaign, an incredible campaigner and activist.
I met him at a 46664 event.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
This is a tool --
this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV, people who are living with HIV.
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
It doesn't have to be in the closet." I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization.
It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV-positive.
They work in the field.
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus.
They have education programs.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
And yes, my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds.
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do, and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
So this is my SING Campaign.
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me.
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years --
I went to about 12 different countries.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway, getting a nice, fat check; singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister, attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him, and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change, which is absolutely necessary.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV.
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness.
And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus.
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --
he's the director of UNAIDS.
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.
It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
This can happen.
And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
And her baby will receive PMTCT, which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus.
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life.
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile.
This is Avelile --
she goes with me wherever I go.
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV/AIDS orphans.
Avelile's mother had HIV virus --
she died from AIDS-related illness.
Avelile had the virus,
she was born with the virus.
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital -- because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story.
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again.
And I'm getting -- the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
This is the transformation that took place.
Isn't it extraordinary?
That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
So, I would like to say to you, each one in the audience, if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care, and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals, specifically five and six, should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up.
I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall.
Thank you very much.
In this powerful talk from TEDGlobal, Rebecca MacKinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace, and asks: How do we design the next phase of the Internet with accountability and freedom at its core, rather than control? She believes the internet is headed for a "Magna Carta" moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection.
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984.
Big Brother: We are one people with one will, one resolve, one cause.
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail.
Narrator: On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984 won't be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
Fast-forward more than two decades:
Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
His app wasn't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine, had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users, and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany.
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
So here's the thing. We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies.
Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed.
Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many, or most, of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question.
So here's the situation.
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation-states.
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace.
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
And their sovereignties, cross-cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
After all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year.
And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond.
As Wael Ghonim, the Google-Egyptian-executive by day, secret-Facebook-activist by night, famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down, "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet." But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles.
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations.
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces.
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May -- not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali.
But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence.
In protest over this, blogger Slim Amamou, who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution, he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem.
In fact, on Twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "Well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
But the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power?
As Riadh Guerfali, the veteran digital activist from Tunisia, remarked over this incident, "Before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
Today, things are a lot more subtle." Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
In fact, in the United States, whatever you may think of Julian Assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.
So we assume that the Internet is a border-busting technology.
This is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service.
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan, it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling.
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet, known as a system of self-discipline.
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009 where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top 20 Chinese companies that are best at exercising self-discipline -- i.e. policing their content.
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients.
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen-centric manner.
Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens,
and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us.
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable.
We don't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit?
And government regulation often isn't helping all that much.
You have situations, for instance, in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies, "We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest." But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three-strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior.
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric Internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement.
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
It was the result of decades of sustained activism, shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy.
Similarly, governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism
that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior.
We need to make the same approach with the Internet.
We also are going to need political innovation.
Eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond.
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
And what does that look like?
At the moment, we still don't know.
But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management, investor behavior, consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around.
Thank you very much.
Journalist Misha Glenny spent several years in a courageous investigation of organized crime networks worldwide, which have grown to an estimated 15% of the global economy. From the Russian mafia, to giant drug cartels, his sources include not just intelligence and law enforcement officials but criminal insiders.
These are grim economic times, fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
And so, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years.
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity.
I refer to organized crime.
Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say,
and these would be wise words, indeed.
But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,
now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy, or McMafia, for short.
So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?
Well, of course, there is globalization, technology, communications, all that stuff, which we'll talk about a little bit later.
But first, I would like to take you back to this event:
the collapse of communism.
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode in our post-war history.
Now it's time for full disclosure. This event meant a great deal to me personally.
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe, like Solidarity in Poland, when I was in my teens.
I then started writing about Eastern Europe, and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,
which is what I was doing in 1989.
And so when 425 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments,
I was ecstatic,
but I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall.
It wasn't long, for example, before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia.
And amongst the chaos, amidst the euphoria, it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989, in Eastern Europe, continued to do so after the revolutions there.
Obviously there were characters like this.
But there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.
Like this character. Remember these guys?
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,
and they were the great celebrities of communism,
with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
They used to get great apartments in the center of town, casual sex on tap, and they could travel to the West very freely, which was a great luxury at the time.
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe.
Or as I like to call them, they are the midwives of capitalism.
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover.
Now in Bulgaria -- this photograph was taken in Bulgaria -- when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe, it wasn't just communism; it was the state that collapsed as well.
That means your police force wasn't working.
The court system wasn't functioning properly.
So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored?
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
We prefer to know them as the mafia.
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined with 14,000 people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991.
Now, when your state is collapsing, your economy is heading south at a rate of knots, the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance, are smuggling, building underground networks and killing people.
But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.
Now, when I was working in the 1990s, I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.
And I couldn't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities, the paramilitary organizations, were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates.
And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise.
And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen, by talking to victims, by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services.
But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.
Why? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing,
but also, as they say in the retail trade, it's location, location, location.
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
Heroin, cocaine, women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals.
And where were they heading?
The European Union, which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,
transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history,
eventually comprising some 500 million people. And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes, sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers.
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business.
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia.
It has zones of distribution, like Mexico and the Balkans.
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption, like the European Union, Japan and of course, the United States. The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world, and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed.
Take Mexico, for example.
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?
Since 1998, five million people have died there.
It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,
but it's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War.
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region.
In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone, in almost every laptop and games console.
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons,
and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime.
Now, let me show you some of my friends in action, caught conveniently on film by the Italian police, and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U., there are very handsome profits to be made,
and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups.
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.
From 1994, for seven years, 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic, from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
And as a consequence of this trade, Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.
Now Italian police, when this trade started, had just two boats which could go at the same speed.
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas.
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution,
and if the police intervened, they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning, rather than chasing the bad guys.
So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats, how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys.
And the answer is six vessels.
And remember, 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night.
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
Well, this is where we come to globalization, because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.
It was the liberalization of international financial markets.
And boy, did that make it easy for the money launderers.
The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre.
In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business,
and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering.
And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked.
But at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.
Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade,
and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime, money laundering, you have to get rid of them.
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities.
And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation, regulation, effective regulation, who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates,
but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street,
and no regulator picked up on it.
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street or in the city of London, fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering?
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.
And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
This one, however, is in central British Columbia where I photographed it.
It's one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C. which ensure that over five percent of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.
Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it, of course, down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud, as it's called, in part because it's marketed as organic, which of course goes down very well in California.
Now, even by the police's admission, this makes not a dent in the profits, really, of the major exporters.
Since the beginning of globalization, the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.
There has, however, been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces.
This, however, may all be about to change, because something very strange is going on.
The United Nations recognized earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
Interestingly, the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down, because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.
Now that is a game changer,
because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world.
When that happens, it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink, in my opinion.
Now, the recession.
Well, organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession.
Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry in the whole world.
And it has no rules to its regulatory system.
Except, of course, it has two business risks: arrest by law enforcement, which is, frankly, the least of their worries, and competition from other groups, i.e. a bullet in the back of the head.
What they've done is they've shifted their operations.
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession.
And so instead, they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way, but above all, two sectors, and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime.
And it's been terribly successful.
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in São Paulo, together.
Hooked it up to my laptop, and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank.
It's really not that difficult.
And it's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it's not so much the technology.
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.
Or to use the technical term for it, there's one born every minute.
You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest.
And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this, of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise of sex and love.
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus, one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,
because the first person I received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine.
Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time, but love was not amongst them.
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox, I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection.
So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys.
These are mosquitoes who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense.
Now, Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days
of infection.
But over the past year or so, researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.
is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market, and so they buy it from the Internet.
And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient.
Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.
The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime.
They affect our bank accounts.
They affect our communications, our pension funds.
They even affect the food that we eat and our governments.
This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.
There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century.
This is a mighty industry, and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes.
It is a major economic force and we need to take it very, very seriously.
It's been a privilege talking to you.
Thank you very much.

You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,
because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to. It's such a large conference.
But he explained to me that he was in a bind, and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions. One -- I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006. And luckily he agreed. And the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."
I invented the Placebo Camera.
It doesn't actually take pictures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper,
and you still feel like you were there.
"Dear Sir, Good day, compliments of the day, and my best wishes
to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly, but let it not be a surprise to you,
for nature has a way of arriving unannounced,
and, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find,
but their echoes sound louder. So I decided to contact you myself, for you to assure me of safety and honesty, if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
I am Mister Michael Bangoora, the son of late Mister Tiamu Bangoora -- who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone -- but was killed during a civil war.
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment, and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business, on which premise I write you.
Before my father death, he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars, which he kept away from the rebel leaders
during the course of the war.
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him,
my father insisted it was not in his possession, and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
Meanwhile, my mother and I is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me.
I quickly made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker, who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown, although he did not know the real contents of the box.
The fund was deposited as a family reassure, in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal,
where I was only given temporary asylum.
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me, are the following: one, be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust; two, provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted; three, receive the funds into your account in trust; take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money until I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
Sincerely, Mister Michael Bangoora." This is really embarrassing.
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
I only prepared 15.
So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.
I'm really sorry.
What's your name?
Mark Serfaas. It's pretty cool, huh? Pursuing happiness.
Are you a virgin? Virgin?
I mean -- no, I mean like in the TED sense?
Are you? Oh, yeah. So what are you,
like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there? Huh? Oh?
You don't know what I'm talking about?
Ah, Mark -- Serfaas.
1,860 -- am I good?
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
Yeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night.
Really cool, we were getting wasted.
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime, they can actually predict what you are going to say next.
And I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy." But they said, "No, but don't show anyone," but they slipped up. And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?" and my name, and it would tell me. And I have to tell you, right now, this is an unadulterated piece of software, this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site, and we're going to test it out live today.
What was I going to say next? And "Ze Frank" -- that's me.
Am I feeling lucky?
Am I feeling lucky?
Audience: Yes.
Ze Frank: Oh. Amazing.
In March of 2001 -- I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."
On a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends, as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th --
th -- 26th birthday party.
By Monday, over a million people
were coming to this site a day.
Within a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said, due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge, I owed them 30,000 dollars.
Needless to say, I was able to leave my job.
And, finally, you know, become freelance.
But some people refer to me more of -- as, like, an Internet guru or -- swami.
I -- I knew I had something.
I'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here, because it's a little too deep for all of you, but -- it's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's -- it's unfortunate that I don't have more time.
Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.
Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
It's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
You can kind of peer into other people's lives, and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration
from the average user.
For example, somebody wrote me. They said, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder, you should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?" And they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out, but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked." And that was embarrassing. But you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure." I hear a lot of you whispering.
And I know what you're saying. You're saying, "Holy crap, how is his presentation so smooth?" And I have to say that it's not all me this year.
I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past, I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know.
And so, this year, Chris sent us a TED Conference simulator.
Which really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches, and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
And I gotta say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff, though.
You can do heckler mode. Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage.
ZF: You get off the stage.
Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.
In case you run over time. I'd -- just one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really -- like to thank all of you for being here.
And frog mode.
"Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp ..."
It's true. Some people say to me, they say, "Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff, and you're not making any money.
"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad -- "I'm trying." You know, I don't know if you're all aware of this, but the video -- the video game market, kids are playing these video games, oh, but, supposedly, there's tons of money. I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent
on these things. So I decided to try my hand.
I came up with a few games.
This is called "Atheist."
I figured it'd be popular with the young kids.
Look, I'll move around and say some things.
So that didn't go over so well.
I don't really understand why you're laughing.
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.
"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
But you come back as a duck.
And this is great because, you know, for a quarter,
you can play this for a long time.
And Chris had said in an email that, you know, we should really bring something new to TED,
something that we haven't shown anyone.
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."
It's the third in the series.
I'm hoping it's going to do well this year.
Do you have a preference? Good choice.
So you can wait for the Second Coming -- which is -- a random number between one and 500 million.
So really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.
Tech joy, to me, means something,
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
And in fact, making things using technology -- and I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice --
I won't -- hold on. Making things, you know --
making things actually does give me a lot of joy.
It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life, and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do, but it's not finished, and you're not starting something -- that really fills my entire life.
And so, what I've done is, I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists.
We're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable,
people feel like they have to read the manual.
So I try to -- -- I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully -- whoa, I'm like -- on the page, but it doesn't exist.
It's, like -- seriously, though -- I try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves.
Here I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack," which, I think, really resonated with the -- working population.
Over 500 entries in three weeks, toilet paper fashion.
Again, people from all over the country doing --
the watch is particularly incredible.
Online drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them.
I think they're wonderful.
I think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process, the process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in.
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,
and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure, awful little thing that they created.
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,
or draw, you know, they draw penises and things like that.
So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
In other words, it's a helping tool.
You can draw your simple stick figure, and then it collaborates with you to create, sort of, like, a post-war German etching.
So you can -- in fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things
that look worse. So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling, and --
so the idea is that you can really, you know, partake in this process, but watch something really crappy look beautiful.
And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me. Here we are, very cool.
Darling. Beautiful stuff.
I mean this is incredible. This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this
and submitted it. It's just gorgeous.
I'm -- I'm dead serious here. I'm actually -- this is not a joke.
But, I think, it's a -- it's a really fun and wonderful thing.
So this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space, which is -- it's basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing.
These are haikus.
None of the haikus were written by the same person, and in fact, no line was -- you know, each line is contributed by a different person
at a different -- at a different time.
I think that the "now tied up, tied down, mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up." It's -- it's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,
if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is, says, "Let's talk" -- that, like, chills you to the very core.
But it's peripheral activities, like these, that allow people to get together, doing fun things. They actually get to know each other, and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital
that we're lacking. And very, very quickly --
I love puppets. Here's a puppet.
It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger,
an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s,
that started doing more elaborate things.
I became interested in puppets,
and I just want to show one last thing to you.
Oh, this is how you make puppets.
Chris Anderson: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.
Elaine Morgan is a tenacious proponent of the aquatic ape hypothesis: the idea that humans evolved from primate ancestors who dwelt in watery habitats. Hear her spirited defense of the idea -- and her theory on why mainstream science doesn't take it seriously.
Well, this is 2009.
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this.
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking.
I say almost every aspect, because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on.
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else.
So I'm going to talk about it.
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference, very, very closely related.
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes, there's a chimp, there's a man; they're astoundingly different, no resemblance at all.
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology, or behavior.
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty, measurable physical differences.
They, that one, is hairy and walking on four legs. That one is a naked biped. Why?
I mean --
if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe there's a reason for that.
If we changed so much, something must have happened.
What happened?
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question. Everybody knew the answer.
They knew what happened.
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
our ancestors went out onto the plain.
That explained everything.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass, or to chase after animals, or to free our hands for weapons.
And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
Everybody knew that, for generations.
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
And they weren't savanna species.
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen.
Shock, horror.
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
Some of it even came from lianas, those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
So we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees, before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
This is not something I've made up.
It's not a minority theory.
Everybody agrees with it.
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London.
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years, forget about it. It was wrong.
We've got to go back to square one and start again."
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
You've got this beautiful paradigm. You've believed it through generations. Nobody has questioned it.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it, relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
And now it's whipped away from under you.
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
Well, we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962.
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
So they say, "Yes it's wrong, but supposing it was right ..."
And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions.
So that is what they have done now.
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
It's what we ought to be doing.
Aaron Filler from Harvard said, "Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes. And we just record what we see."
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science. And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
And if you're going to say, "I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures," you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,
for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.
And the irony of it is, that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
There was one waiting in the wings. when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist, said, "I think what happened, perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time."
He kept it to himself for 30 years.
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
You've exposed us to public ridicule!
You must never do that again."
And at that time, it became set in stone: the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis, as part of the lunatic fringe of science.
Well I don't think that. I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind, the things that made us different from everybody else, and all our relatives.
Let's look at our naked skin.
It's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair, are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus, the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee. And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps, could that be why we are naked?
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.
I mean, look at the elephant.
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
So back in 1982 I said, "Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."
Peals of merry laughter!
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?" But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor. This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors.
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked,
because look at the sea otter.
But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime, or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat, which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
And take bipedality.
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with, because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs, if they want to, for a short time.
There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs,
and that is when they are wading through water.
Do you think that's significant?
David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
Look at the fat layer.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
In the whale it's complete:
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen.
We have got skin lined with this layer.
It's the only possible explanation of why humans, if they're very unlucky, can become grossly obese,
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
The question of why we can speak.
We can speak.
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds.
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak. And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver, and you can see that, compared with gorilla, we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years, this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,
and it is not lunatic fringe.
And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love.
There is nothing there.
They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum.
How do they react when I say these things?
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times is, "But it was investigated.
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning, when Hardy put forward his article."
I don't believe it.
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind, and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
It's never been done.
I ask people sometimes, and they say, "I like the aquatic theory!
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
They say "Well ...
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.
And if you've got a scientific problem like that, you can't solve it by holding a head count, and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
Some of them have come over.
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.
Anybody else out there? Come on in.
The water is lovely.
And now we've got to look to the future.
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen. Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years. "Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
That would be very sad.
The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive, and say, "I've found it.
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
No sign of that happening either.
I don't think there is a third option.
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing.
If you look back at the early years of the last century, there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel, and the believers in Darwin.
It ended with a new synthesis:
Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas blending together.
And I think the same thing will happen here. You'll get a new synthesis.
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together.
And we can move forward from there, and really get somewhere.
That would be a beautiful thing.
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said, "At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen, what's holding it up?
I can tell you that in three words.
Academia says no.
They decided in 1960, "That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
And it's not easy to change their minds.
The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole.
The textbooks don't mention it.
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason to it.
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics, won't touch it with a barge pole.
So we never hear the case put for it, except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe.
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
Somebody up there is issuing the commandment,
"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
And if you hope to make progress in this profession, and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself, because it will get in your way."
So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood.
But you know, that makes me feel good, because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood.
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive."
Right. I'll go ahead with that.
And secondly, he says, "You must never be afraid to rock the boat."
I'll go along with that too.
Thank you very much.
Artist Kate Hartman uses wearable electronics to explore how we communicate, with ourselves and with the world. In this quirky and thought-provoking talk, she shows the "Talk to Yourself Hat", the "Inflatable Heart", the "Glacier Embracing Suit", and other unexpected devices.
My name is Kate Hartman.
And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate.
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans, relate to ourselves, each other and the world around us.
So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics.
And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form.
And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.
And it's pretty simple.
Everybody's got one -- all of you.
I can guarantee, everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies.
Don't be ashamed.
It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.
And so when working as an interaction designer, or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on, in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within.
So within my own work, I use a broad range of materials and tools.
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with a hat.
And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking.
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else.
So I make other hats as well.
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
It's fairly self-explanatory.
It physically carves out conversation space for one.
And when you speak out loud,
the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?
What kind of an experience do they have?
And how are they transformed by wearing it?
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves. So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.
And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication.
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions.
So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange, but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.
And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations.
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say.
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.
And I thought, "Well, hey! Maybe if I want to better relate to walls, maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me.
And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time.
And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course.
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them, but what I'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations.
Because there seems to be an issue.
The glaciers are actually leaving us.
They're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether.
And so I actually live in Canada now, so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.
And this one's particularly interesting, because, of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter.
When I meet a glacier for the very first time, what do I do?
There's no kind of social protocol for this.
I really just don't even know how to say hello.
Do I carve a message in the snow?
Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube Morse code.
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool, like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice.
But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship.
And I was really struck by how much it affected me.
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier. And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug.
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.
These are initial musings for this project.
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists, technologists, scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations.
So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.
Thanks.
Politicians are strange creatures, says politician Omar Ahmad. And the best way to engage them on your pet issue is a monthly handwritten letter. Ahmad shows why old-fashioned correspondence is more effective than email, phone or even writing a check -- and shares the four simple steps to writing a letter that works.
One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion, and you've turned it into stewardship.
You actually put action to the issues you care about.
But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out.
So, how do you do that?
One of the things I should probably tell you is, I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career, and that sort of warped my framework.
So, when you start to think about politicians, you've got to realize these are strange creatures.
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions, and they have very strange breeding habits, how do you actually work with these things?
What we need to understand is: What drives the political creature?
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:
One is reputation and influence.
These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job.
The second one -- unlike most animals, which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self.
Now you may think it's money, but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself.
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
You can send them an email.
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost.
It doesn't matter, it's spam.
How about you get on the phone?
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone, "Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
That doesn't move.
Face to face would work, but it's hard to set it up.
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation, but it takes some time to build up.
So what actually works?
And the answer is rather strange.
It's a letter.
We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.
Letters actually work.
Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff.
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean.
So, how are you going to write your letter?
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it, but this is actually critical.
And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter.
It is so novel to see this, that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me.
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
Here's my promise to you:
If you are consistent and do this, within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
Now, I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with.
Now, when you approach these animals, you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them, and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
So in paragraph number one, what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this: You appreciate them.
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else, but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
So, here you go.
Paragraph number two: You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind.
When you do this, don't attack people; you attack tactics.
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
Paragraph number three: When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death, so you have to give them an exit.
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
"Obviously, you're intelligent. If you had the right information, you would have done the right thing."
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
You're the safe place to come in to.
So, in paragraph number four, you're going to tell people, "If no one is providing you with this information, let me help."
Animals do displays. They do two things:
They warn you or they try to attract you and say, "We need to mate."
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
You do a number of things: you're a vice president, you volunteer, you do something else.
Why is is this important?
Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature: that you have influence in a large sphere, and that my preservation depends on you.
Here is one very quick hack, especially for the feds in the audience.
Here's how you mail your letter.
First of all, you send the original to the district office. So, you send the copy to the main office.
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?" Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read.
So, what your letter means:
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party, and political officials are the pinatas.
We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.
I got this letter when I was first elected, and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.
This is an opportunity at real dialogue,
and if you have stewardship and want to communicate, that dialogue is incredibly powerful.
So when you do that, here's what I can promise: You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
Get writing.
Venice is sinking. To save it, Rachel Armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture made of inert materials and, well, make architecture that grows itself. She proposes a not-quite-alive material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon, too.
All buildings today have something in common.
They're made using Victorian technologies.
This involves blueprints, industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities.
This is not sustainable.
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy.
And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way.
So, I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture,
and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach.
That means we're generating them from scratch.
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,
and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter.
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in, when we're thinking about sustainable materials.
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
Now all this is -- and it's magic -- is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
And it has no DNA.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural.
So here we are. These are protocells, patterning their environment.
We don't know how they do that yet.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
This is a violent process.
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate.
And that's the shell around that globular fat.
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter.
That can't be energetically sensible.
So, bottom-up materials actually exist today.
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today, and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting.
It looks beautiful.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere.
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.
So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material.
They think big. Okay?
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials, we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls, or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water.
So, one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles.
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice.
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.
So, here is the technology we have today.
This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials.
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
Now, this is the very interesting part.
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light, toward the dark foundations.
We've observed this in the laboratory.
The protocells can actually move away from the light.
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,
which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries.
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
Secondly, these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems, which means they can perform in similar ways.
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture.
And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.
Thank you.
Sebastian Thrun helped build Google's amazing driverless car, powered by a very personal quest to save lives and reduce traffic accidents. Jawdropping video shows the DARPA Challenge-winning car motoring through busy city traffic with no one behind the wheel, and dramatic test drive footage from TED2011 demonstrates how fast the thing can really go.
As a boy, I loved cars.
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.
Like this.
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
We built the hardware and the software.
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert.
And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California.
We've driven 140,000 miles.
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving.
It's the perfect driving mechanism.
We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here.
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself.
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.
Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.
Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts.
Man: Oh, my God. What?
Second Man: It's driving itself.
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,
but I can do something for all the people who died.
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people?
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines?
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute?
You could regain this time.
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone.
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
Thank you.
With streams and rivers drying up because of over-usage, Rob Harmon has implemented an ingenious market mechanism to bring back the water. Farmers and beer companies find their fates intertwined in the intriguing century-old tale of Prickly Pear Creek.
This is a river.
This is a stream.
This is a river.
This is happening all over the country.
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States.
On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well.
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone.
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
They're the veins of the ecosystem, and they're often empty veins.
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story.
This is Prickly Pear Creek.
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.
It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years, it's looked like this in the summer.
How did we get here?
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana.
In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.
But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
There were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872, both involving Prickly Pear Creek.
And in 1921, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights."
These senior water rights are key.
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this.
Some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream.
And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right, they risk losing their water right, along with the economic value that goes with it.
So they have no incentive to conserve.
So it's not just about the number of people; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it.
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience, we still have this.
It's a broken system. There's a disincentive to conserve, because, if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right.
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities.
Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here.
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free,
and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.
There's another thing happening around the country, which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint.
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water, they're trying to be really efficient with their water use, and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand.
Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana, and it involves beer.
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer.
If you include all the drain, it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.
Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption,
but they still use millions of gallons of water.
I mean, there's water in beer.
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem?
These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers.
After all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing,
and for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer.
So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned, and they're looking for some way to address the problem.
So how can they address this remaining water footprint?
Remember Prickly Pear.
Up until now, business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing, and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore.
Remember Prickly Pear.
It's a broken system.
You've got a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks.
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right.
After all, it is their water right, and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream, it's their right to do so.
But they have no incentive to do so.
So, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so.
We pay them to leave their water in-stream.
That's what's happening here.
This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion, leaving the water in the stream.
He doesn't lose the water right, he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it, to the stream, instead of to the land.
Because he's the senior water rights holder, he can protect the water from other users in the stream.
Okay?
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream.
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream.
We then take the measured water, we divide it into thousand-gallon increments.
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems.
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream.
It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems, while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them.
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation.
It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used.
These transactions create allies, not enemies.
They connect people rather than dividing them.
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
And most importantly, it's working.
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.
We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana, with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
And when we make these connections, we can and we do turn this into this.
Thank you very much.
Google's "Jolly Good Fellow," Chade-Meng Tan, talks about how the company practices compassion in its everyday business -- and its bold side projects.
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?
He certainly doesn't look like me.
He looks like this.
His name is Matthieu Ricard.
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI, versus the right prefrontal cortex.
And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts.
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science.
Which leads us to a question: What was he thinking when he was being measured?
Perhaps something very naughty.
Actually, he was meditating on compassion.
Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever.
Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life.
My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale.
And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work.
Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore.
Compassion is something that creates happiness.
Compassion is fun.
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game.
Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
But if compassion was fun, everybody's going to do it.
Therefore, to create the conditions for global compassion, all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun.
But fun is not enough.
What if compassion is also profitable?
What if compassion is also good for business?
Then, every boss, every manager in the world, will want to have compassion -- like this.
That would create the conditions for world peace.
So, I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting.
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google, my company.
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world, but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for 10 years, so I'll use Google as the case study.
Google is a company born of idealism.
It's a company that thrives on idealism.
And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide.
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern.
It's sort of a funny pattern.
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something.
And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official.
So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up.
And let me give you some examples.
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big.
Another example, three Googlers -- a chef, an engineer and, most funny, a massage therapist -- three of them, they learned about a region in India where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility.
So what do they do?
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.
And they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people.
During the Haiti earthquake, a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices.
In China for example, one mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China, involving more than 1,000 schools in China, working on issues such as education, poverty, health care and the environment.
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts.
And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job.
And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this," and the company said, "Yes."
So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company, because Googlers found compassion to be fun.
But again, fun is not enough.
There are also real business benefits.
So what are they?
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
What does that mean?
There are three components of compassion.
There is the affective component, which is, "I feel for you."
There is the cognitive component, which is, "I understand you."
And there is a motivational component, which is, "I want to help you."
So what has this got to do with business leadership?
According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins, and documented in the book "Good to Great," it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness.
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."
These are leaders who, in addition to being highly capable, possess two important qualities, and they are humility and ambition.
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good.
And because they're ambitious for a greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos.
And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders.
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion, we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits, tones down, what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us, therefore creating the conditions for humility.
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good.
In other words, compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
And this is the first compelling business benefit.
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce.
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good.
It creates a vibrant, energetic community where people admire and respect each other.
I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers?
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration, initiative and creativity.
It makes us a highly effective company.
So, having said all that, what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting?
In our experience, there are three ingredients.
The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good.
So always think: how is your company and your job serving the greater good?
Or, how can you further serve the greater good?
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in.
That's one.
The second ingredient is autonomy.
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
And one of our most popular managers jokes that, this is what he says, "Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum." And he considers himself one of the inmates.
If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way.
The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth.
Leadership training in Google, for example, places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities, such as self-awareness, self-mastery, empathy and compassion, because we believe that leadership begins with character.
We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence, which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."
It's less naughty than it sounds.
So I'm an engineer by training, but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course, which I find kind of funny, because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence.
What a company.
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?
It works in three steps.
The first step is attention training.
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
Therefore, any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training.
The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time.
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence.
The second step follows the first step.
The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery.
So using the supercharged attention from step one, we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes.
What does that mean?
It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity and from a third-person perspective.
And once you can do that, you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery.
The third step, following the second step, is to create new mental habits.
What does that mean? Imagine this.
Imagine whenever you meet any other person, any time you meet a person, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, "I want you to be happy.
I want you to be happy." Imagine you can do that.
Having this habit, this mental habit, changes everything at work.
Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people, and it creates trust, and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace.
Someday, we hope to open-source "Search Inside Yourself" so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference.
And in closing, I want to end the same place I started, with happiness.
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy -- the Dalai Lama, who said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.
If you want to be happy, practice compassion." I found this to be true, both on the individual level and at a corporate level.
And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too.
Thank you.
Political prisoners aren't the only ones being tortured -- the vast majority of judicial torture happens in ordinary cases, even in 'functioning' legal systems. Social activist Karen Tse shows how we can, and should, stand up and end the use of routine torture.
In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia, and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel.
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners, that I would never have written a letter for him, because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody.
He was not a political prisoner.
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle.
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia, but of the 113 developing countries that torture, 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured.
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool.
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst, but, in fact, 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners.
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems, and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it's cheaper than having a legal system, cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time.
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community, if we make a decision, to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime, but it will require three things.
First is the training, empowerment, and connection of defenders worldwide.
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel.
And the third is commitment.
So in the year 2000, I began to wonder, what if we came together? Could we do something for these 93 countries?
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms.
My first experiences, though, did come from Cambodia, and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were, in 1994, still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
And even 20 years later, there was only 10 lawyers in the country, so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys, you'd meet women and you'd say, "Why are you here?" Women would say, "Well I've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him." So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember, as I was training, I said, "Okay, what do you do for an investigation?" And there was silence in the class, and finally one woman stood up, [inaudible name], and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."
She said, "I have defended more than a hundred people, and I've never had to do any investigation, because they all come with confessions." And we talked about, as a class, the fact that number one, the confessions might not be reliable, but number two, we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this, especially as it was now against the law.
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws.
And I still remember the first cases where they came, all 25 together, she would stand up, and they were in the back, and they would support her, and the judges kept saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them." But one day the perfect case came, and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller, she was sitting outside of a house.
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was, but the police came, they got her, there was nothing on her.
She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
And when they brought her case to the judge, for the first time he stood up and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released." And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see, they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia.
But Cambodia is not alone.
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?
Or is it other countries?
But it is in so many countries.
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone.
Or a woman, I picked up her baby, really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute." It wasn't a baby, she was three.
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here," because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison.
And when I walked up to the prison director, I said, "You've got to let her out.
A judge would let her out." And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it, but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do?" So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases.
But we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers, but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference.
For example, in Cambodia, it was that [inaudible name] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way, in China, they always tell me, "It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together." Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent, after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said, "I've been here for one year, eight years, 12 years without a lawyer," he came and we had a training together and he said, "I have heard it said" -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources." And then he said, "But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice." And with that, he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases.
The key that we see, though, is training and then early access.
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers, and what they told me is that they said, "Hey, look, we don't have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time." And I said, "But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here.
What's going on?" I met with one of the development agencies, and they were training prosecutors and judges, which is the normal bias, as opposed to defenders.
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual.
I said, "I'm gonna copy this." It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect.
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.
But I said to them, "I just have one question, which is, by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?" And after a pause, they said, "They had been tortured." So the pieces are, not only the training of the lawyers, but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel, because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured.
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds like we could do it, but can we really do it?" Because it sounds big.
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment.
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces.
We have a program called JusticeMakers, and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things, but how can we support them?
So it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice.
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world, from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC, who with five thousand dollars do amazing things, through SMS programs, through paralegal programs, through whatever they can do.
And it's not only these JusticeMakers, but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward.
So in China, for instance, great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished.
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers, and said, "How can we get this out? How can we make sure that this is implemented?
This is fantastic." And he said to me, "Well, do you have money?" And I said, "No." And he said, "That's okay, we can still figure it out." And on December 4, he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League, from 14 of the top law schools, who organized themselves, developed posters with the new laws, and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights.
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders.
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel.
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this.
And people often say to me, "You know, this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
Never going to happen." And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery, or end apartheid.
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit.
Now, there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders, which they share from each other, is: "Take courage friends, the road is often long, the path is never clear, and the stakes are very high, but deep down, you are not alone." And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders, but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it, we can end torture as an investigative tool.
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are -- and I'd be happy to talk to you at any point -- "But what can I really do?" Well, I would say this. First of all, you know what you can do. But second of all, I would leave you with the story of Vishna, who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice.
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison, everybody loved him, including the guards, so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars.
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time
that Vishna was getting bigger, which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
So he would come to the first bar, the second bar and then the third bar, and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through, and come back, third, second, first. And he would grab my pinkie, because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit.
You know, he never quite made it to all of them every day, but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him, and he would put his fingers through.
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they looked forward to him. And I was like, here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
He was born in a prison with almost nothing, no material goods, but he had a sense of his own heroic journey, which I believe we are all born into. He said, "Probably I can't do everything.
But I'm one. I can do something.
And I will do the one thing that I can do." So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together, and invite you into this journey with us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Paola Antonelli, design curator at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, wants to spread her appreciation of design -- in all shapes and forms -- around the world.
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down, like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.
And I can basically look everywhere I want, see every movie I've always wanted to see.
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you're reading,
there's something really soothing and easy.
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,
because I discovered ... it took me a while to understand it, but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,
and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
Just to give you an example: this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
We were in Queens,
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown, so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.
But it's not only that.
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica;
it's its 50th anniversary this year.
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together, trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --
and the movie starts playing in my head already.
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you.
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do homeworks at home?
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,
and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,
and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.
And a lot of nationalism came in.
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop, but they were very proud
so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good -- they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.
And I keep it going, and I just got, also, this suggestion from Milan: it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted; it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic.
So, think of your own,
send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay, and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
In Italy, in Milan especially, contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
But design -- oh, my God.
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store, is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated.
It's just what you find at the store.
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries.
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
It's really interesting:
what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but -- decoration, interior decoration.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people,
because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline, so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important. And then they make a little tent for the baby.
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,
and it is miles away from the fancy furniture, but still, it's part of my same field of passion.
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA
because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,
and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929, which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better.
There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,
but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --
Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions:
one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture.
And then there was good design for very low price.
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;
at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.
And then, for instance, this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001, where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
And you see IDEO there.
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --
it's a very famous Italian song.
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,
and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:
designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs, current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts.
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious.
The idea behind her work was that at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime, but I don't want to focus on my shows.
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day I have to ask, "What does that mean?"
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead, and therefore, he was a maverick.
So, designers do need to be mavericks,
because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA
and it ended at the beginning of last year. It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition
until, slowly but surely, it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety.
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws,
so it was really wide-ranging.
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;
design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
It's a suit for civil disobedience.
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --
it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified --
and the police is reminded; it's like having a flower in front of the rifle. And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,
like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away;
or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --
I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;
or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self, and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters.
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis, do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
And sometimes by doing this kind of research, you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.
They're quite beautiful.
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self.
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,
and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,
and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical.
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo, Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money.
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
So really, design takes everything into account,
and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances, as we become more and more wireless and impalpable, designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.
Sometimes hammer-on.
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti, explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
And that makes sense.
In moments of war there's great technological innovation,
and in the world you have to do without -- well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel, you had to do without aluminum.
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market.
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:
fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
I think that this is a strange moment.
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously, just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,
so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
But it surely is a very important moment for design,
because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing technology making open-source possible also in the world of design, but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint, but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers.
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors rather than on objects.
Especially the good ones, not all of them.
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur, which is quite fantastic.
He's another young designer from France who's working -- and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients, especially children, in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,
so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,
so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery.
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth
so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
The next show that I'm going to work on -- and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science.
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common -- the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --
and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales, and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful.
Thank you.
Ory Okolloh tells the story of her life and her family -- and how she came to do her heroic work reporting on the doings of Kenya's parliament.
So what's image got do with it?
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages, because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up.
But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about.
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see.
We're not the only ones.
And you know, it's amazing. I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
Just think about that, you know?
And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff.
Now, why is that a problem?
A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, 'Forget the poor people. Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help."
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
We start with poverty.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family.
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
When things were bad, we had porridge.
And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey.
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free. And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term.
You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money.
But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did. They talk about corruption.
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools.
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school.
I missed the cutoff by one point.
And I was so disappointed, and I was like, "Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
And my father said, "OK, listen. Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
You know, it's just one point. I mean, maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there." So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt.
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are?
And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there.
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know?
And we left, and I swore to myself, to beg for anything in my life."
They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
Disease.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999. He never told anyone that he had AIDS, his fear of the stigma was so strong.
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on.
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.
The first time he got sick, he recovered.
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
You know, so money ran out.
He got sick again.
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it.
And that kept him going.
But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
And finally, we figured, well, OK, we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation.
And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him.
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me.
How would you look at me?
With pity, you know. Sadness.
And this is how you look at Africa.
This is the damage it causes.
You don't see the other side of me.
You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know?
And I just wanted to personalize that.
Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what?
But it's damaging.
And I'm not unique, right?
Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation.
He was like, I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!" And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters -- -- we're ignoring the potential.
So, what is to be done?
First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
We heard about that yesterday.
We had some of them this morning.
blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa.
So we need to start getting better.
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia.
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
It only has five contributors.
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers. The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up -- is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
He's the only African who's contributing to this.
People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this.
What are we doing?
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
Why are we not generating our own content?
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa.
So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives.
The cheetah generation. The aid approach, you know, is flawed.
And after all the hoopla of Live 8, we're still not anywhere in the picture.
No, you're not. But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize.
And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay?
You know, just jump. The continent needs you.
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures.
With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems.
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
And because I'm needed here, you know?
I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing.
One is because I'm pretty aggressive, and I try and find, you know, opportunities.
But there is such a need, you know?
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
We're now moving into East Africa.
And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity.
I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs.
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
Everything else on there is a labor of love.
We've manually entered all the data there.
And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament.
We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions.
There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask.
And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart.
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
What are they doing?
You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies, we need --
where's that coming from, you know?
Another thing is that these leaders We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know? They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
And how can we change that? So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here?
I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, "BBut it's not scalable, you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal." It's not that easy, you know? And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart. I was paying her school fees. A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
You know, she's now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people. So, don't underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt. He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson. And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don't normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"
I said, "I want to be a lawyer." And he was like, "Why? You know,
we don't need another lawyer in the United States." And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I'm poli-sci Ph.D. But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out." It was like, "Where do you want to go?" And to me at that time university -- I was at University of Pitts for undergrad, and that was like heaven, OK, because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school." He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart, you have all these things going for you." And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh." Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school. And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me. And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard, you're that good, OK? And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up." And he built me up, you know? And this is just an illustration. You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know? A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born.
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know? That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move.
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life.
I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us. And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you.
Anemia is a major -- and completely preventable -- cause of deaths in childbirth in many places around the world, but the standard test is invasive and slow. In this witty and inspiring talk, TED Fellow Myshkin Ingawale describes how he and his team created a simple, portable, low-cost device that can test for anemia without breaking the skin.
I like to build stuff.
I've always liked to build stuff.
My team at Biosense, a startup I co-founded with my doctor and engineer friends, has built a technology called ToucHB, which can do blood testing of hemoglobin without pricks, without needles.
I believe this is going to democratize health care.
They're two big words, I don't know what they mean.
In fact, in 2009, I was even more clueless.
I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next.
I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D., which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact, contributors interact, how articles are formed in Wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.
I was also building something called the Copenhagen Wheel, which is just a really beautiful, beautiful electric bike at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab.
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai, my house, back for a vacation.
So at that time I was planning a road trip.
I visited a place called Parol about two hours north of Mumbai.
This is a place where my friend, Abhishek Sen was interning.
He's a doctor there.
And that's his actual photograph.
So Abhishek actually made me wait.
He was out there in Parol delivering a baby.
I was waiting, and when he did emerge, he was ashen-faced.
He told me that there had been two deaths; the mother and child both had died.
The reason, he told me, was something called post partum hemorrhage.
He explained this meant severe internal bleeding.
What was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia.
Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew -- that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal.
It is something which probably the cure is known.
I mean, folic acid, iron tablets -- very cheap, affordable cures exist to control anemia.
So why was this woman dying?
It was completely preventable.
Five minutes away from there, I had the center, the medical center, which was distributing subsidized iron tablets.
So the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me.
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this.
My mom is a pediatrician, and I asked her.
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia.
Take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a Coulter counter.
This is a $10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai.
It's also available here or in any part, I guess, in Europe and most cities in the world.
But this is not available in Parol.
Also, that woman who was operating the machine, the technician, is not available in Parol.
Now this struck me as -- I love to fix things. I wanted to fix this.
I got a friend of mine, an engineer, and three other doctors -- Abhishek joined the team -- and we wanted to solve this problem.
By the time I step down from here there will be 10 people who have lost their lives through a completely, completely preventable problem.
Now let me take you back to Parol.
You saw the woman there, the nurse.
In India this is called an ASHA worker.
It's essentially a village health worker, a matron.
She is really the center of the health care system.
Public health care runs on the ASHA worker, not the doctor.
Now we knew we had to design something which she could use.
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have.
We knew it had to be something which had no needles, no pricking, so it would have adoption, it would not have medical waste, all those problems.
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.
And thirdly, it had to be something which she could carry in her kit.
She goes village to village doing screenings.
We thought we could build it, so we built it.
But, but it didn't work.
So we built it again.
And we did this 32 times.
But I'm very excited to tell you that last year we did build it -- it works.
And I have it here in my purse.
So this is a machine called the ToucHB Quik.
What it does is it measures my hemoglobin, oxygen and pulse rate.
I put it on my finger, switch it on, and in about 20 seconds it'll give me, on the little screen here, a value of hemoglobin, oxygen saturation and heart rate.
This will help ASHA workers diagnose anemia at the point of care. I'll explain a little bit about how it works.
You might have seen a little light inside of it.
In fact, there are three lights in there, three wavelengths of light.
And we essentially pass light right through the tissue, and from understanding how much of it is transmitted, how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed, we can figure out how much hemoglobin is there in the blood.
And this is something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography.
We are actually really very excited about what else non-invasive techniques like this will be able to crack in the future.
One of the things which my intern here, Pratesh, built is a mobile application, which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go.
There's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing.
I would love to tell you a little bit more about it.
But fundamentally, what I believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia.
It's the death rates caused by anemia globally.
You'll notice, of course, that there are hot spots -- South Asia, Africa.
My business plan is very simple.
I'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world.
That's a simple bottom-line business plan.
And by the time I'm done, in 2020, when the WHO publishes the data again, this is going to be the map of anemia.
Thank you.
Shame is an unspoken epidemic, the secret behind many forms of broken behavior. Brené Brown, whose earlier talk on vulnerability became a viral hit, explores what can happen when people confront their shame head-on. Her own humor, humanity and vulnerability shine through every word.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.
And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.
And I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell." I said, "Thanks. I feel really -- I'm not functioning." And she said, "What's going on?" And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data, as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living, I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
At what point did I think that was a good idea?" And she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.
It was not really you.
It was a little different than what you usually do.
But it was great." And I said, "This can't happen.
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people." And she said, "Well, I think it's too late." And I said, "Let me ask you something." And she said, "Yeah." And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb?" And she said, "Yeah." And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?" And she goes, "Uh ... no." So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither.
That ... me neither." And I'm thinking to myself, "Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?" And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit." She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever." And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
I said, "If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over." I had no contingency plan for four million.
And my life did end when that happened.
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar.
But I want to talk about what I've learned.
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.
The first is vulnerability is not weakness.
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable, think, "God, vulnerability's weakness. This is weakness?" How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
The majority of people.
Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage?
Vulnerability is not weakness.
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.
It fuels our daily lives.
And I've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest.
One of the weird things that's happened
is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies.
And so many of the calls went like this, "Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.
We'd like you to come in and speak.
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame." What would you like for me to talk about?
There's three big answers.
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector: innovation, creativity and change.
So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.
To create is to make something that has never existed before.
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
The second thing, in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage, the second thing I learned is this: We have to talk about shame.
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
When I became a "vulnerability researcher" and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I'm not kidding.
I'll give you an example.
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear: "Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!" I'm a fifth generation Texan.
Our family motto is "Lock and load." I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six.
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!" I turn around, I go, "Hi." She's right here and she said, "You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown." At this point parents are, like, pulling their children close.
"Look away." And I'm so worn out at this point in my life, I look at her and I actually say, "It was a frickin' spiritual awakening." And she looks back and does this, "I know." And she said, "We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'" And she said, "Our tagline is: 'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'" You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh." And I see you. But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability.
I learned about these things from studying shame.
And so I want to walk you in to shame.
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.
And we're going to walk in.
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there.
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around.
Here's why. We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country, and I think globally, around race, right?
Yes? We heard that.
Yes?
Cannot have that conversation without shame, because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame.
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery, which is have a checklist.
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame, because when they teach those folks how to suture, they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful.
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here.
Myshkin Ingawale, I hope I did right by you.
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily.
And he said, "I saw this need.
So you know what I did? I made it." And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!" And he said, "And it didn't work.
And then I made it 32 more times, and then it worked." You know what the big secret about TED is?
I can't wait to tell people this.
I guess I'm doing it right now.
This is like the failure conference.
No, it is.
You know why this place is amazing?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail.
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
I've failed miserably, many times.
I don't think the world understands that because of shame.
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
And it goes like this: "It is not the critic who counts.
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles. The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.
But when he's in the arena, at best he wins, and at worst he loses, but when he fails, when he loses, he does so daring greatly."
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.
That's what life is about, about daring greatly, about being in the arena.
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door, and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this," shame is the gremlin who says, "Uh, uh.
You're not good enough.
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg, he was in Sing Sing.
I know those things that happened to you growing up.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO." Shame is that thing.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who?
Us.
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?" The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
Shame is "I am bad." Guilt is "I did something bad." How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?" How many of you would be willing to say that?
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.
And here's what you need to know.
Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders.
And here's what you even need to know more.
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same.
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.
For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial: "I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man." For women, shame is do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be.
And it's a straight-jacket.
For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
Shame is one, do not be perceived as what? Weak.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing,
said, "I love what you have to say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men." And I said, "I don't study men." And he said, "That's convenient." And I said, "Why?" And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?" I said, "Yeah." "They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down.
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us.
And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads, because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else." So I started interviewing men and asking questions.
And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher," but he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
And to get out from underneath it, to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
The top answers in this country: nice, thin, modest and use all available resources for appearance.
When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too.
And so I'll leave you with this thought. If we're going to find our way back to each other, vulnerability is going to be that path.
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
And that is seductive.
But the truth is that never happens.
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there, that's not what we want to see.
We want you to go in.
We want to be with you and across from you.
And we just want, for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with, to dare greatly.
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.
Plenty of robots can fly -- but none can fly like a real bird. That is, until Markus Fischer and his team at Festo built SmartBird, a large, lightweight robot, modeled on a seagull, that flies by flapping its wings. A soaring demo fresh from TEDGlobal 2011.
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird.
Birds are very agile.
They fly, not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings.
So we looked at the birds, and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight, and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings.
So what would be better [than] to use the Herring Gull, in its freedom, circling and swooping over the sea, and [to] use this as a role model?
So we bring a team together.
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders.
And the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly over your heads.
So be careful later on.
And this was one issue: to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down.
So why do we do all this?
We are a company in the field of automation, and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient,
and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.
So I now would like you to [put] your seat belts on and put your hats [on].
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird.
Thank you.
So we can now look at the SmartBird.
So here is one without a skin.
We have a wingspan of about two meters.
The length is one meter and six, and the weight, it is only 450 grams.
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
In the middle we have a motor, and we also have a gear in it,
and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor.
So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors, so we know exactly where the wing is.
And if we now beat up and down ...
we have the possibility to fly like a bird.
So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion,
and if you go up, the wings are not that large, and it is easier to get up.
So, the next thing we did, or the challenges we did, was to coordinate this movement.
We have to turn it, go up and go down.
We have a split wing.
With a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.
So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion, from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure.
Only if you control and regulate it, you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
So the overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts in flight.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Markus, I think that we should fly it once more.
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.
India's revolutionary Aravind Eye Care System has given sight to millions. Thulasiraj Ravilla looks at the ingenious approach that drives its treatment costs down and quality up, and why its methods should trigger a re-think of all human services.
Good morning.
I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no, what use do we have for a blind woman?
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it, but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity, their independence, and their status in the family.
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
And the irony is that they don't need to be.
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses, then almost one in five Indians will require eye care, a staggering 200 million people.
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.
He started this with no money.
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan.
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model.
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
The last three decades, we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people.
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients, send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations, and, on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation.
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village, and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being, you seem to be one with him.
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it.
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
When we grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify ourselves with all that is in the world, so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it.
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently, and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
They feel they can train people all over the world, irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things, to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places.
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us.
He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's.
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care, techniques, methods, all in the same way, and make it available in every corner of the world.
The problem of blindness is gone.
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, as American or African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service, and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems.
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem, we are talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.
And one of the early innovations, which still continues, is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner, and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma.
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital.
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it.
They receive surgery the following day, and then they will stay for a day or two, and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from, and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
And this happens several thousand times each year.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then, to our dismay, we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
So we had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on.
They receive comprehensive eye exams.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served, which is over 50,000 people.
And the second year went up to 75 percent.
So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital.
And how much will they pay for this?
We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care?
We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence.
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market, because it focused on the non-customer, and then by reaching the unreached, we're able to significantly grow the market.
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists?
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready.
So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
And then to support the surgeon, we require a certain workforce.
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost.
So, putting all this together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else.
This is a very busy table, but what this really is conveying is that, when it comes to quality, we have put in very good quality-assurance systems.
As a result, our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom, and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it?
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency.
I think that has been a big savior, even now.
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus.
The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes.
The revenues increase at a higher level, giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free.
I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
But this really requires going beyond what we do, or what we have done, if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables.
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well.
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology?
There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit.
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market, and they're used in about 120-odd countries.
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries?
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does, near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
And we do about 300,000.
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
So we're really comparing apples to apples.
We looked at cost.
So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
I think there is more to it.
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
Maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables, or regulations, their defensive practice.
So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again.
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm.
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side.
Now, how do you create compassion?
Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it?
There are a bit harder issues.
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
TR: Thank you very much.
At TEDxBerlin, Fabian Hemmert demos one future of the mobile phone -- a shape-shifting and weight-shifting handset that "displays" information nonvisually, offering a delightfully intuitive way to communicate.
I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question: how can we make digital content graspable?
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now.
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there --
it's virtual.
On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world. It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
So the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?
That's my question.
If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.
The question is: what's next?
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.
The first one is mass.
As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.
So, could we use that in mobile phones?
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.
It is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around,
and you can feel where it's heavy.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
Another thing it's good for is navigation --
it can guide you around in a city.
It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time; you have your eyes free to see the city.
Now, mass is the first thing;
the second thing, that's shape.
We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands.
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --
it's thick.
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile.
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,
and this one can change its shape.
We can play with the shape itself.
For example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be; but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.
It's like tapered to the downside.
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands.
It's fairly simple.
Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself.
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, "Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content.
You can't see it, but it's there."
And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge.
The shape is the second thing.
The third thing operates on a different level.
As humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
Think of a hamster in the pocket.
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
Let me show you the living mobile phone.
So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box,
but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic.
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
Oh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe --
very exciting.
How do we calm it down?
You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again.
So, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want.
So, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that.
What's behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future;
rather than that, technology, a bit more human.
The man who helped usher in the environmental movement in the 1960s and '70s has been rethinking his positions on cities, nuclear power, genetic modification and geo-engineering. This talk at the US State Department is a foretaste of his major new book, sure to provoke widespread debate.
Because of what I'm about to say, I really should establish my green credentials.
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country,
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
And I've stuck to that.
Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.
1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends, basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,
so it's the same now, 30 years later,
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today, called Whole Earth Discipline.
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on.
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,
and that's mostly in the developing world, where that's happening.
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities.
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries, and nine times bigger.
It's qualitatively different.
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
In other words, the rise of the West, dramatic as it was, is over.
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:
1.3 million people a week coming to town, decade after decade.
What's really going on?
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
Subsistence farming is drying up basically.
People are following opportunity into town.
And this is why.
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages, and it's because I never lived in one.
Because in town -- this is the bustling squatter city of Kibera, near Nairobi -- they see action. They see opportunity.
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm.
As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.
There is plenty going on.
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.
The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters, all one billion of them, are building the urban world,
which means they're building the world --
personally, one by one, family by family, clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.
They even build their own infrastructure.
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
And then gradually gentrifies.
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,
not the working slums; they help create prosperity.
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums, it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.
These people are valuable as a group.
And that's how they work.
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people, "Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.
Famine mostly is a rural event now.
There are things they care about.
And this is where we can help.
And the nations they're in can help.
And they are helping each other solve these issues.
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.
You look at that lane on the right.
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"
The answer is, "Everything."
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.
It's much more interactive.
And the scale is terrific.
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can.
They're helping each other do it.
They're doing it through an outlaw thing, the informal economy.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
Furthermore, people in the informal economy, the gray economy -- as time goes by, crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world, or they can join the legitimate world.
We should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.
There's all kinds of activity.
In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself, but it performs services for the city at large.
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private, tiny, unofficial school.
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things. So one thing slammed up against another, such as in Sao Paulo here.
That's what cities do. That's how they create value, is by slamming things together.
In this case, supply right next to demand.
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.
Proximity is amazing.
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.
Connectivity between the city and the country is what's going to keep the country good,
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.
This is what makes cities -- this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.
Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster of subsistence farms, and head to town.
And when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly.
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town.
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road, or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.
More than half. The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.
Another billion is expected.
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.
And that will determine a lot of how we function.
Now, for us environmentalists, maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb. People get into town. The immediately have fewer children.
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids, and the birthrate goes down radically.
Very interesting side effect here, here's a slide from Phillip Longman.
Shows what is happening.
As we have more and more old people, like me, and fewer and fewer babies.
And they are regionally separated.
What you're getting is a world which is old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way, in the north.
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing, doing new things, in the south.
Where do you think the action is going to be?
Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse than we think, faster than we think.
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system, full of runaway positive feedbacks, hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.
Here's just a few samples.
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones.
From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades,
and what goes along with that, which is resource wars and chaos wars, as we're seeing in Darfur.
That's what drought does.
It brings carrying capacity down,
and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people. And then you're in trouble.
Shift to the power situation.
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city, or a city planet.
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity: coal, some gas, nuclear and hydro.
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
And everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy. So with hydro maxed out, coal and lose the climate, or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source, and maybe save the climate.
And if we can eventually get good solar in space, that also could help.
Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities.
So, between coal and nuclear, compare their waste products.
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear, the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can.
Whereas a coal-burning plant, a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
each car having 100 tons.
And it puts 18 thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air.
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms,
nuclear is about even with solar and wind, and ahead of solar --
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.
And does nuclear really compete with coal?
Just ask the coal miners in Australia. That's where you see some of the source, not from my fellow environmentalists, but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
Well the good news is that the developing world, but frankly, the whole world, is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.
This is good for the atmosphere.
It's good for their prosperity.
I want to point out one interesting thing, which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration, and good things like that.
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on, might serve even better. The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors, for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
And they're selling these floating reactors, only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt, 25 million watts, and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva, which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.
Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
Here's another American design that came out of Los Alamos, and is now commercial.
Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.
They're typically buried in the ground.
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
In terms of proliferation, nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room, 20 percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear.
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
And so I would like to see the GNEP program, that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.
And I was glad to see that president Obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in Prague the other week.
One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops, in my view, as a biologist, have no reason to be controversial.
My fellow environmentalists, on this subject, have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.
Despite their best efforts, genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming, which leaves the soil in place, getting healthier from year to year --
slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere.
They reduce pesticide use.
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller,
and therefore more wild area is freed up.
By the way, this map from 2006 is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth from Europe,
and they're finally getting out from under that.
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.
This is a moral issue.
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available.
Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now, especially in government circles, though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,
but it will be on your plate -- not this year but pretty soon,
because some harsh realizations are coming along.
This is a list of them.
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.
There will be events, like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave, which happened a while back.
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.
Like wars over water, such as in the Indus.
And as those events keep happening we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
But there's this little problem with geoengineering:
what body is going to decide
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
Because everybody is downstream, downwind of whatever is done.
And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization.
But if we just say "OK, China, you're worried, you go ahead.
You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.
I should say, it is more practical than people think. Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,
one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.
This one came from the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --
cooled the earth by half a degree.
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year, that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.
That's nothing, compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy.
Just to run by another one: this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds, by atomizing seawater;
that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.
A nice one, because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places,
is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,
and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil. So here is where we are.
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene, the human-dominated era. We are stuck with its obligations.
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were, "We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it." The first words of Whole Earth Discipline are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it." Thank you.
Days before this talk, journalist Naomi Klein was on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico, looking at the catastrophic results of BP's risky pursuit of oil. Our societies have become addicted to extreme risk in finding new energy, new financial instruments and more ... and too often, we're left to clean up a mess afterward. Klein's question: What's the backup plan?
I just did something I've never done before.
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
This is the boat we were on, by the way.
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it.
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding.
It's still working its way up the food chain.
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962.
She pointed out that the "control men" -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds.
But they forgot this: the fact that birds dine on grubs, that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT.
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent.
Thus the title "Silent Spring."
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties.
And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months.
After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature, suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness, with our lack of control, as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it -- "top hats," "top kills" and, most memorably, the "junk shot" -- the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world.
But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up.
If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy.
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years.
Our leaders barrel into wars, telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy.
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down.
And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole.
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price.
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do, or not to do, about climate change.
Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate,
on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?"
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is, "What if those scientists are right?"
Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty.
Better to err on the side of caution.
More overt, the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed, but rather on the industry that stands to profit.
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP.
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: "What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions?
Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?"
Or we ask, "How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive?
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees Celsius?"
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science.
The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops.
So once again, why do we take these crazy risks with the precious?
A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like "greed."
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,
because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money.
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris.
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness.
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay.
And you actually don't have a lot of options.
You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen.
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future.
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?"
Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
Don't feel ashamed.
Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk, but personally, I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall, because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time.
So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness.
Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do.
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least.
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides.
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" -- brings us closer, I think, to the root of our collective recklessness.
Because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message.
Here's what I'm talking about.
Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them, our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature --
the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer, the narrative of manifest destiny, the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places.
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport.
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, "Slap Mother Nature in the face."
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus.
I'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor, are they? -- because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story.
We slapped Mother Nature around and won,
and we always win, because dominating nature is our destiny.
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume."
In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it.
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do.
Because this is our real master-narrative:
however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources.
A new bubble will replace the old one.
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one.
In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped.
And it's also the story of modern capitalism,
because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system, one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers.
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie.
The Earth always did have limits. They were just beyond our sights.
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp.
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin?
Now on the one hand, exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill," because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show.
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall.
There are still no limits. There will always be another frontier.
So stop worrying and keep shopping. Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual.
This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic.
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy.
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water, including the icy Arctic seas, where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen.
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States.
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else.
So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests.
The oil is not liquid. You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil.
So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees.
Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand.
The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
Now looking at these images, it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation, which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England.
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built.
That's a person down there by the wheel.
My point is that this is not oil drilling. It's not even mining.
It is terrestrial skinning.
Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray.
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada.
How else to describe this, but as a form of mass insanity?
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long.
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us, this is how civilizations commit suicide, by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes.
The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too.
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie, just like in the Rapture.
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.
Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these.
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called, is that, as the planet heats up, we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space, thereby cooling the planet.
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide.
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.
The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested.
They don't know if they'll work, and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles, particularly media circles, with a relief tinged with euphoria.
An escape hatch has been reached.
A new frontier has been found.
Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.
We badly need some new stories.
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on, that put the precautionary principle into practice, even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested, blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. That this is our only home. There is no escape hatch.
Call it karma, call it physics, action and reaction, call it precaution -- the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit.
Thank you.
Illustrious jugglers the Raspyni Brothers show off their uncanny balance, agility, coordination and willingness to sacrifice . Now, if you'll just stand completely still...
Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ... DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;
it's something we just kind of learned for this,
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
Nice show. Man, that was good!
DH: Thank you.
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
You actually just did that.
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...
DH: All right, let's show them something special.
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ... TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on.
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it.
BF: Shut up.
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down.
BF: Oh yeah, it does.
BF: Oh, Daniel.
DH: One more?
Perfect.
Perfect.
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.
BF: Also three with his left.
DH: Perfect.
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose?
BF: First try? Once on purpose?
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?
BF: Good idea. Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
DH: He's looking at me.
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help.
Oh, good. All right.
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips
in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
And then we thought, "How stupid."
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
BF: I think that's the next session.
DH: Next session?
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.
DH: Please stand up, Richard.
Oh, sorry. DH: Now Richard, please ... BF: OK, sorry.
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?
BF: Sure.
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me --
I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.
BF: No, come stay up with him. Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
It's kind of neat. OK.
DH: Wow, you've been working out.
BF: No, shut up!
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
OK, here we go.
Have him hold your wrist so I can ... DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
There you go.
OK.
OK, hold on.
RW: Hmmm.
DH: First one.
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?
What happened there?
BF: I think we were just outside.
DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.
DH: One more, one more.
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.
RW: Do I get to hold them?
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.
Could you just push that?
DH: Wow! Boy!
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.
DH: Let's jump this way, though.
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ... DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
DH: True. Barry ... BF: I'm going to run up behind him.
DH: Leap over my shoulder.
BF: Up and over his shoulders.
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...
Still juggling.
Impossible, you say?
BF: Incredible, you say?
DH: Why bother, you say?
BF: Here we go.
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.
DH: I think so, that's right.
Even the pencil.
BF: He invented the pencil.
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect.
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.
Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage?
Or a virgin for a sacrifice?
BF: Anything?
DH: Where's Gloria?
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
BF: Over the top, over the top.
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
BF: Yeah, it's all right.
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ... BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.
DH: Everything up here's OK?
BF: Yeah.
DH: Then here we go.
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs? Is that possible? I can still see a little.
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
We went too far.
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
DH: May we have our jumping music please?
May we have it a bit louder?
BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.
BF: We're going on.
DH: All right, we'll try again.
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
DH: Whenever you're ready.
BF: There we go!
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
Somebody dance! Come on!
Wow, wow, OK, stop.
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this.
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.
DH: The French judge ... BF: One more quick thing.
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.
BF: Well, you know ... DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships.
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition.
DH: That's right.
BF: Good.
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.
BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
And look, it has a twin!
DH: There's still one more by my foot.
What do you want me to do with it?
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year.
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
BF: Nice.
DH: I got that --
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
BF: Nice.
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.
DH: How about that? I'll do it again.
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
And it's awfully windy over there.
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
Oh, look how it lies there.
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
Too much Olympics.
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
What gem of knowledge?
What pearl of wisdom?
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
Is that your final answer?
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
DH: I do, I do.
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
DH: We will juggle seven.
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
BF: Yes.
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
Put your tongue away, Barry.
BF: Oh, oh, whoa.
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
Because now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back ... BF: Seven-club juggling.
DH: ... to back.
BF: Thank you, that's it.
BF: Thank you guys!
DH: Thank you very much!
Daniel Kraft demos his Marrow Miner -- a new device that quickly harvests life-saving bone marrow with minimal pain to the donor. He emphasizes that the adult stem cells found in bone marrow can be used to treat many terminal conditions, from Parkinson's to heart disease.
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year, I didn't bring a human brain, but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients, most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases.
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here, who is a volunteer donor.
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia.
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses, and another doctor across from me.
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle, you know, not too big.
And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue, and kind of punch it into the hard bone, into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out, each time, with a syringe.
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
About 200 times usually.
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,
let alone Bob, whose rear end looks something more like this, like Swiss cheese.
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
And there is probably a better way to do this.
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
This is it.
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
Our standard see-through patient.
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times, we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. And we have a flexible, powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate, or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.
No robots required.
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia, and do this harvest as an outpatient.
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.
And played around with this a little bit.
And our team members developed this technology.
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out, but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient.
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
You all know about embryonic stem cells.
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
Adult stem cells are throughout our body, including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years.
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease, vascular disease, orthopedics, tissue engineering, even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes.
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year, generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out, which translates to better outcomes.
It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors.
It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier, to use in the future should you need it.
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors, who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future.
Thanks.
In this accessible talk from TEDxBoston, Richard Resnick shows how cheap and fast genome sequencing is about to turn health care upside down.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the human genome.
Chromosome one, top left.
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes.
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome; men have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.
So if you zoom in on this genome, then what you see, of course, is this double helix structure -- the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters, or we call them bases, right: A, C, G and T.
How many are there in the human genome? Three billion.
Is that a big number?
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers.
But in fact, if I were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen, we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
So it's really quite big.
And perhaps because of its size, a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it.
And so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later, the genome was sequenced and published.
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
That was all done on a machine that looks like this.
It costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it.
Well folks, I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it.
So now what we do is we take a genome, we make maybe 50 copies of it, we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads, and then we sequence them, massively parallel.
And then we bring that into software, and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is.
And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like, the Human Genome Project: 3 gigabases, right.
One run on one of these machines: 200 gigabases in a week.
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer, and there's no sign of this pace slowing.
So the price of a base, to sequence a base, has fallen 100 million times.
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998, waiting until 2011, and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
World population, PC placements, the archive of all the medical literature, Moore's law, the old way of sequencing, and here's all the new stuff.
Guys, this is a log scale; you don't typically see lines that go up like that.
So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.
And we know this based on the machines that are being placed.
This is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future.
In fact, there's one lab in particular that represents 20 percent of all that capacity.
It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.
What does this mean for medicine?
So a woman is age 37.
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
She is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.
She goes home.
Two years later, she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer.
Unfortunately, treated again with surgery and chemotherapy.
She comes back three years later at age 42 with more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.
Six months later, she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia.
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.
So first, the way in which this woman was treated, in as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting.
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson, at the Genome Institute at Washington University, who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
And he sequenced, he took skin cells, healthy skin, and cancerous bone marrow, and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks, no big deal.
And then he compared those two genomes in software, and what he found, among other things, was a deletion, a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called TP53.
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene, you're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.
So unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman, but it does have severe, profound if you will, implications to her family.
I mean, if they have the same mutation, and they get this genetic test, and they understand it, then they can go and get regular screens, and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life.
Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins, diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.
Their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up, and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching, she was able to convince the medical community that, in fact, they had something else.
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia.
And so they were given L-Dopa, and their symptoms did improve, but they weren't totally asymptomatic.
Significant problems remained.
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery, who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies.
They're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools.
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced.
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR, which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug, and they're effectively normal now.
Guys, this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing.
And at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.
Today it's $10,000. Next year it's $1,000.
The year after it's $100, give or take a year.
That's how fast this is moving.
So here's little Nick -- likes Batman and squirt guns.
And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim.
And it's not that he's not eating, it's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut.
So a hundred surgeries later, he looks at his mom and says, "Mom, please pray for me. I'm in so much pain."
His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on, but he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced."
And what they find is a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.
So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food essentially, and that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death.
But the gene that regulates that down is broken.
And so this informs, among other things, of course, a treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.
And after nine months of grueling recovery, he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.
The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today.
Today, it's here.
And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five, 10, 20 years just because of this one thing.
Which is a fantastic story, unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production.
So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought, of flood, of pests and pesticides.
Now look, as long as we continue to increase the population, we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods, and that's the only position that I'll take today.
Unless there's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating?
None, not one.
This is a typewriter, a staple of every desktop for decades.
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
And then more general versions of word processors came about.
But ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption.
It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything.
And suddenly we had Netscape, and we had Yahoo and we had, indeed, the entire dotcom bubble.
Not to worry though, that was quickly rescued by the iPod, Facebook and, indeed, angry birds.
Look, this is where we are today.
This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are.
So what I'd like you to consider is: What does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome, but they connect to genomes all across the planet?
So I just recently had to buy life insurance.
And I was required to answer: A. I have never had a genetic test, B. I've had one, here you go,
and C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
Thankfully, I was able to answer A, and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening.
But what would have happened if I had said C?
Consumer applications for genomics, they will flourish.
Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend? Sure.
DNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that.
Personalized genomic massage anyone?
There's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene, the so-called cheating gene.
So anybody who's here today with your significant other, just turn over to them and swab their mouth, send it to the lab and you'll know for sure.
Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
Now think of it, it's 2016 and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns, but also her personal genome.
And it looks really good.
And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same.
Do you think that's not going to happen?
Do you think it would have helped John McCain?
How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me? Raise your hand.
Anybody? Nobody.
Typically, there's one or two.
So my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
They all hated each other.
And they all moved to different parts of the planet.
So it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet, but I don't know.
But imagine if my genome were deidentified, sitting in software, and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there, and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations.
Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now.
that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents, "Would you be willing to meet your third cousin?"
And if we both say yes, voila! Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn.
Now this is probably a good thing, right?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on.
But maybe it's a bad thing as well.
How many fathers in the room? Raise your hands.
Okay, so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child.
Look -- These genomes, these 23 chromosomes, they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet.
And like any new technology, it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind, or not.
And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.
Thank you.
Physicist and surfer Garrett Lisi presents a controversial new model of the universe that -- just maybe -- answers all the big questions. If nothing else, it's the most beautiful 8-dimensional model of elementary particles and forces you've ever seen.
Whoa, dude. Check out those killer equations. Sweet.
Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.
It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.
Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.
Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps.
These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors.
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral, we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors --
if it was just chance, or destiny, or what?
Now, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high, he would tell us that our question was completely stupid.
These corals can be quite kind of mean, you see, and I have surfing scars to prove that.
But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.
That he was in all these other locations as well, but experiencing them as separate individuals.
For a coral, branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world.
Unlike us, a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works.
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral.
It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around, since we only ever get to experience one possibility.
This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
The cat likes this version better.
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
In the branch in which the sample radiates, it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead.
But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.
These realities are experienced separately by each individual.
As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
This seems weird to us, because each of us only experiences an individual existence, and we don't get to see other branches.
It's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales.
It can be summed up in a single sentence: Everything that can happen, does.
That's quantum mechanics.
But this does not mean everything happens.
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't.
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles.
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.
Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles, what they are and how this balance works.
In this machine, a beam of protons and anti-protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles, with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
This enormous machine -- the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva --
has a circumference of 17 miles and, when it's operating, draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey.
We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced
in any individual collision.
Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized.
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton.
Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced, and remain invisible to us.
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before, so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
But before talking about what we might see, let me describe the particles we already know of.
There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.
Most of us are familiar with electrons.
A lot of people in this room make a good living
pushing them around.
But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino, with no electric charge and a very tiny mass.
In contrast, the up-and-down quarks have very large masses, and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons
inside atoms.
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties, and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges.
These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations, which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses.
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles.
The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter
via particles called photons.
There is also a very weak force called, rather unimaginatively, the weak force, that interacts only with left-handed matter.
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge, and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names --
they're his fault.
Finally, there's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter via its mass and spin.
The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces.
These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists, is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see.
And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk.
Now, if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges, there are 226.
That's a lot of particles to keep track of. And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles.
But if we plot them out according to their charges, some beautiful patterns emerge.
The most familiar charge is electric charge.
Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one,
and quarks have electric charges in thirds.
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one.
These particles also have anti-particles, which have opposite charges.
Now, it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges: hypercharge and weak charge.
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space, the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction.
The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge,
which make this pattern.
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model, and it was put together back in 1967.
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.
The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.
It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass.
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram, the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space.
So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space.
We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions.
The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them.
Whenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions.
If a particle and an anti-particle collide, it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions.
At this point, anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
For example, this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision.
In further interactions, the charges must always balance.
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino, and these three still add to zero total charge.
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty.
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction,
which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
In a strong interaction, a strong force particle, such as this one, interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one, to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one.
And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies, holding the atomic nuclei together.
But these four charges corresponding to three forces
are not the end of the story.
We can also include two more charges
corresponding to the gravitational force.
When we include these, each matter particle has two different spin charges, spin-up and spin-down.
So they all split, and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space.
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions, and see that it's quite pretty.
Right now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles.
This is what we know for certain.
Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments.
From this pattern, we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales. The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful.
But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet.
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone, and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe.
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.
So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric, could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern
to give electromagnetism.
In order to do this, we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions.
When we introduce a new direction, we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction, and then we can rotate it in with the others.
If we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
When we look at this new unified pattern, we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
This is the way theories of unification work.
A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset.
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen.
This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.
Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles: the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation.
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.
However, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space, then we can assign unique new charges to each particle.
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions, and see what the whole pattern looks like.
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
This Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape.
One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity,
explaining gravity.
Together with quantum mechanics, the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales.
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful, and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles, each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape.
As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns
contained in this one.
And with a particular rotation, we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once.
It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification, we can see some holes where new particles are required
by this pattern.
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be, two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern, giving us the full E8.
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure
in mathematics.
It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable.
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new.
In 1623, Galileo wrote this: "Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze, is written in the language of mathematics.
Its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."
I believe this to be true, and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.
Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff, the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth.
But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure, beautiful geometry.
Joined with quantum mechanics, this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral, with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern.
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider, we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern, that will be very, very cool.
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern -- well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.
And, of course, bad for me personally.
Now how bad would that be?
Well, pretty bad.
But predicting how nature works is a very risky game.
This theory and others like it are long shots.
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature.
That's what doing theoretical physics is like:
there are a lot of wipeouts.
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out.
But in science, if something isn't working, you have to toss it out and try something else.
Now, the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life.
I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.
I try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing -- my own three charge directions.
This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing, I still know I've lived a good life.
And I try to live in beautiful places.
For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui, a very beautiful place.
Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.
I'm going to let you in on that secret.
This was a view from my home office on Maui.
And this is another, and another.
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar, but in slightly different places.
That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.
I've chosen a very unusual life.
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time
doing what I love.
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times, but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper-intelligent coral.
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people.
So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I probably understood two percent of that, but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb.
Your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
CA: That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together.
So are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are, are somehow an E8 object of possibility?
I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...?
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.
And that's the one that I said we knew for certain.
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E8 pattern could be the rest of the picture.
And these patterns of points that I've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience.
And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.
CA: But a string theorist, as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- I know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be -- CA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron?
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
GL: Well, as far as we know electrons are point particles, so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is, all possibilities are expanding and developing at once.
And this is why I use the analogy to coral.
And in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time.
And, as I said, the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are, themselves.
So through quantum field theory, they manifest themselves as points and interact that way.
I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.
CA: It doesn't really matter.
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder, and I certainly want to understand more of this.
But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.
The legendary chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall talks about TACARE and her other community projects, which help people in booming African towns live side-by-side with threatened animals.
Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir, but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening.
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other, from one group of nests to the next.
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday.
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam. And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind through DNA genetic profiling.
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey, who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was -- because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils, from the shape of the muscle attachments,
something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them.
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today, then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like, human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient, ancient past.
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
They are more like us than any other living creature, and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more, although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years, a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing, sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals, so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history.
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice, so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures, many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
And they swagger and they throw rocks.
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion, precursors to love and true altruism.
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part, are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
They are very territorially aggressive.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations.
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild, have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from, the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees, like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
This is just one photograph from the air, and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago, and realized that outside the park, this forest, which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies, that a question came to my mind. "How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees, when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo.
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries, methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded, almost desert-like land up in these mountains.
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland, so that within two years they can again be productive.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.
Most important of all, I believe, is working with small groups of women, providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
And we've got, as is the case around the world, about 95 percent of all loans returned.
Empowering women, working with education, providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school, in the clear understanding that, all around the world, as women's education improves, family size drops.
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
something's happening for conservation.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers, asking what they were interested in.
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve, they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees, so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
This is an area way outside the National Park, stretching out into all these very degraded lands.
And as these villages have a better standard of life, they are actually agreeing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside, so that once again, as the trees grow back, the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact -- as they must for genetic viability -- with other remnant groups outside the National Park.
So TACARE is a success.
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa, around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure.
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems.
There is a great deal of poverty. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile, particularly when you cut down trees, and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion, as desperate populations cut down more and more trees, so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families, what's going to happen? Something's got to give.
And the other problems -- in not only Africa, but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --
what are we doing to our planet?
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American, we need three new planets.
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are, arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth, with this extraordinary brain, capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.
The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, "How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here, but the developed world -- major decisions involving millions of dollars, and millions of people, are often based on, "How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
And these decisions affect Africa.
As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests, I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe, talking in the United States, going to Asia.
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
The earth is poisoning our foods.
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century --
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural, industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world, seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
The mangroves are being cut down; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
We've talked about the soil erosion.
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses, so called, leading to climate change.
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
All around the world climates are mixed up. And it's the poor people who are affected worse.
It's Africa that already is affected.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support, who are too poor to buy food, who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping -- as the last of the trees are cut down.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
I asked a question. "Why?"
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
And these young people, when I talk to them, basically they were either depressed or apathetic, or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing, "We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it."
We have compromised their future.
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age, I feel this desperation.
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots, which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall. See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet, environmental and social. It's a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
The most important message of Roots and Shoots: every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room, we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well.
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
It depends on how old they are, and which country, whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university, with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
And every group chooses, between them, three different kinds of project to make this a better world, recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other.
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world.
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife, domestic animals as well.
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves, in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures, between religions and between us and the natural world.
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
We not do have more than this one planet.
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing, one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money, or just using them to feed their families, and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment, because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens.
It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
Once again, they're useful members of society.
We have this program in prisons as well.
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots, with older kids talking to younger ones.
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that, which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world: "Jane, you've seen so many terrible things, you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million, at the turn of the century, to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And I mean, think of the technologies.
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
It's one of my hobbyhorses.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.
Do we care about the planet for our children?
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
Do we care about their future?
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world, we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
What we buy. What we wear.
And choose to make these choices with the question, how will this affect the environment around me?
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart, and we join hands around the world.
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us, and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
All of these technologies we can use.
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
This change, this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed, with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
And an example is the TACARE program.
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump -- if you stop hacking them for firewood, which you don't need to because you have wood lots, then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction, can be given a second chance. That's my next book.
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope, and we've heard about this so much in the last two days: this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people, the resilience of the human spirit, So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty, or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it, sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society, and take their part in changing the world.
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
We could make a very long list, but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment, with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
People like this are so inspirational.
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
And we need some environmental role models as well, and I've been hearing some of them today.
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again, with everyone at TED.
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things, especially the Roots and Shoots program.
And just a last word on that -- the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today.
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow.
Thank you.
This demo -- from Pattie Maes' lab at MIT, spearheaded by Pranav Mistry -- was the buzz of TED. It's a wearable device with a projector that paves the way for profound interaction with our environment. Imagine "Minority Report" and then some.
I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense --
a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across.
And some of you may argue, well, don't today's cell phones do that already?
But I would say no.
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?"
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process.
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device.
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system.
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.
The system tracks the four significant fingers.
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize.
But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors.
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc.
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc.,
again using all natural gestures.
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, etc.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk to up to any surface, including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely portable, and can be ...
So one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels.
And, as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he's picking up, using either image recognition or marker technology, and give him the green light or an orange light.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice.
If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating --
it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
If he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated.
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about
You can get the latest sports scores etc.
This is a more controversial one.
As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages.
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc.
And, if you need to know what the current time is it's as simple as drawing a watch -- on your arm.
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across.
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
He does deserve a lot of applause because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
Thank you.
Artist Dianna Cohen shares some tough truths about plastic pollution in the ocean and in our lives -- and some thoughts on how to free ourselves from the plastic gyre.
I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. I've been working with plastic bags, which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years.
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
And I thought, "Great. It's ephemeral just like us."
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing.
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic.
And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
I then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. And my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is, "Oh my God!
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
And the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale.
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world.
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market.
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator, and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies.
So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
We have many initiatives that we're working on, but some of them are very basic.
One is: if 80 to 90 percent of what we're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic, then why don't we call it what it is.
It's plastic pollution.
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
What is the reality of that?
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
And if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bottles, most of it is only down-cycled, or incinerated, or shipped to China.
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things, while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
So this is a big issue for us.
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's, and that is refuse.
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
Alternatives exist;
some of them are very old-school.
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in.
And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family.
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle, if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water, versus purchasing plastic bottled water.
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve.
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives.
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics.
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
Thank you.
Too much of the world lacks access to clean drinking water. Engineer Michael Pritchard did something about it -- inventing the portable Lifesaver filter, which can make the most revolting water drinkable in seconds. An amazing demo from TEDGlobal 2009.
Good morning everybody.
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
The first thing is water.
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference, over the past couple of days.
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
But what if it wasn't?
What if it was from a source like this?
Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea.
I talked a lot in the past about statistics, and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
But they just don't seem to get through.
And I think I've worked out why.
It's because, using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving.
So we just switch off:
us, governments and aid agencies.
Well, today, I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved.
By the way, since I've been speaking, another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea.
And four children have just died.
I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry.
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004, when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in, playing out on TV.
The days and weeks that followed, people fleeing to the hills, being forced to drink contaminated water or face death.
That really stuck with me.
Then, a few months later, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
Day one: nothing.
Day two: nothing.
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water.
That's when I decided I had to do something.
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife.
However, after a few failed prototypes, I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
Okay, now for the science bit.
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
So a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
The smallest virus, on the other hand, is about 25 nanometers.
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
So nothing is getting through.
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
Would you like to see that?
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
We're in the fine city of Oxford.
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here. And this is the water.
But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
And this is from my pond.
Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.
Okay. Right.
We're just going to pour that in there.
Audience: Ugh!
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm.
So I'm just going to put that in there.
Put that in there. There we go.
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
So we're just going to put that in there as well.
Okay. Now.
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.
You just scoop the water up.
Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
Okay. There we go.
Replace the top.
Give it a few pumps. Okay?
That's all that's necessary.
Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
There we go. Mind the electrics.
That is safe, sterile drinking water.
Cheers.
There you go Chris.
What's it taste of?
Chris Anderson: Delicious.
Michael Pritchard: Okay.
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
It'll last for 6,000 liters.
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
It's good for another 6,000 liters.
So let's look at the applications.
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
We ship water.
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
Diseases spread. More resources are required.
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
But by thinking differently, and shipping these, people can stay put.
They can make their own sterile drinking water, and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work.
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure and pipe work, is too expensive.
When you run the numbers on a calculator, you run out of noughts.
So here is the "thinking different" bit. Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
And where do people live? Near water.
All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that?
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
Or we could use one of these.
The same technology, in a jerry can.
This will process 25,000 liters of water;
that's good enough for a family of four, for three years.
And how much does it cost?
About half a cent a day to run.
Thank you.
So, by thinking differently, and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water.
They can get it from a source nearby.
So with just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.
To put that into context, The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid.
But why stop there?
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
So the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result, and the two million kids that die every year, will live.
Thank you.
Phyllis Rodriguez and Aicha el-Wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss. Rodriguez' son was killed in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001; el-Wafi's son Zacarias Moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence. In hoping to find peace, these two moms have come to understand and respect one another.
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
And it is.
And yet, it feels natural to us now.
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001.
We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later.
At the time, we knew that it was political.
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful.
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly. Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families. When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, "What a brave woman. Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength.
I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other.
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy.
But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy.
But her suffering is equal to mine.
So we met in November 2002,
and Aicha will now tell you how that came about.
Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
So they introduced me to five families.
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
She was the only mother in the group.
The others were brothers, sisters.
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me.
I suffered a lot as a mother.
I was married when I was 14.
I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive.
I know she really cried for her son.
But she knows where he is.
My son, I don't know where he is.
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
I don't know what happened to him.
So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change.
It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children.
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children.
I talk against violence, against terrorism.
I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good.
This is why I'm here in front of you.
PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members.
But we were all so nervous.
"Why does she want to meet us?" And then she was nervous.
"Why did we want to meet her?" What did we want from each other?
Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept. Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."
But she reached out to us in that way,
and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings.
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had.
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much.
And I think it's all about being afraid of the other,
but making that step and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"
So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?
Because our time is up.
AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other.
You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous.
You must be tolerant.
You have to fight against violence.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.
This is what I wanted to say.
Paddy Ashdown claims that we are living in a moment in history where power is changing in ways it never has before. In a spellbinding talk at TEDxBrussels he outlines the three major global shifts that he sees coming.
There's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the 19th century.
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain in the 1930s.
And the poem goes: "On the idle hill of summer, lazy with the flow of streams, hark I hear a distant drummer, drumming like a sound in dreams, far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by, dear to friend and food to powder, soldiers marching, soon to die."
Those who are interested in poetry, the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
But what Housman understood, and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too, was that the long, hot, silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close, and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes.
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by turbulence, and all too often by blood.
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned, if you like, to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world, the new powers that exist in the world, are beginning to take form.
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times, and all too often very bloody times.
By the way, it happens about once every century.
You might argue that the last time it happened -- and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too -- was that when power passed from the old nations, the old powers of Europe, across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America -- the beginning of the American century.
And of course, into the vacuum where the too-old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars, and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times.
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
And the first of these, the first two of these, is about a shift in power.
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to, which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
And what is happening today is, in one sense, frightening because it's never happened before.
We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different.
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation.
It's also moving vertically.
What's happening today is that the power that was encased, held to accountability, held to the rule of law, within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power.
And where, at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law, on the international stage it is not.
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides: the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters, the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers, if you like, the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently, the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries.
These live in a global space which is largely unregulated, not subject to the rule of law, and in which people may act free of constraint.
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment.
It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint, but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later, unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted -- international trade, the Internet, etc. -- but also by the things you don't want -- international criminality, international terrorism.
The revelation of 9/11 is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth, nevertheless, those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning.
It's said that something like 60 percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11 actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which 9/11 destroyed.
You see, our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison, which is about destroying our systems and our ways.
Sooner or later, sooner or later, the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow.
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is, that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power, then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space.
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim: to bring governance to the global space.
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.
I'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution.
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions.
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
The world needs an international forum.
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
But when it comes to governance of the global space, my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions.
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems, treaty-based agreements, to govern that global space.
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization, entirely treaty-based, and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States, to account if necessary.
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization.
The G20: we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation.
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
Now there's a problem there, and we'll come back to it in a minute, which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions, to fill that governance space, then what happens to the weak who are left out?
And that's a big problem, and we'll return to it in just a second.
So there's my first message, that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently, then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space.
And watch that beginning to happen.
My second point is, and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing, but power is not just shifting vertically, it's also shifting horizontally.
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations, has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the Mediterranean, the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking, away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard] to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.
Now that begins with economic power, but that's the way it always begins.
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies, the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world.
I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East; something different is happening.
My guess is, for what it's worth, is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years, 15, but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered; it has radically changed.
We are coming out of 50 years, most unusual years, of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world, in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus.
But that's not a usual case in history.
In fact, what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history.
You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world.
Up until now, the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
They will remain the most powerful nation, but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world.
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China, of course, though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
It's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy.
But that's a subject of a different discussion.
You see India, you see Brazil.
You see increasingly that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans, much more like Europe in the 19th century.
Europe in the 19th century: a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning, used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."
There was a balance, a five-sided balance.
Britain always played to the balance.
If Paris got together with Berlin, Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
Now notice, in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world, you have fixed alliances -- NATO, the Warsaw Pact.
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances.
But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances.
And that's the world we're coming into, in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed.
Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said, "Britain has a common interest, but no common allies."
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out, have to reach out, beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world.
Note, that when we went into Libya, it was not good enough for the West to do it alone; we had to bring others in.
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves, and we haven't succeeded.
My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power, Western institutions and Western values.
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together, it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world.
But that's no longer true.
Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War.
The West got together -- the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund -- the problem solved.
Now we have to call in others.
Now we have to create the G20.
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends.
Let me make a prediction for you, which is probably even more startling.
I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough.
People say to me, "The Chinese, of course, they'll never get themselves involved in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."
Oh yes? Why not?
How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag, serving under the U.N. command in the world today?
3,700.
How many Americans? 11.
What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates?
The Chinese naval contingent.
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
They want to keep the sea lanes open.
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values, but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.
It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging.
And here's the third factor, which is totally different.
Today in our modern world, because of the Internet, because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here, everything is connected to everything.
We are now interdependent.
We are now interlocked, as nations, as individuals, in a way which has never been the case before, never been the case before.
The interrelationship of nations, well it's always existed.
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.
But now we are intimately locked together.
You get swine flu in Mexico, it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later.
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
There are fires in the steppes of Russia, food riots in Africa.
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone, not connected with others, not working with others, is no longer a viable proposition.
Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself, nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory, because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.
I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
At that time, the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only: how strong was our army, how strong was our air force, how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.
Now the enemy is inside the walls.
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country, I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country, who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
It's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.
It's its capacity to lock together its institutions.
And this tells you something very important.
It tells you that, in fact, our governments, vertically constructed, constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution -- vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks, command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely.
You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen, is the network.
It's your capacity to network that matters, both within your governments and externally.
So here is Ashdown's third law.
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet; it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age, where everything is connected to everything, the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others.
The most important bit about your structure -- whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment, whether you're a business -- is your docking points, your interconnectors, your capacity to network with others.
You understand that in industry; governments don't.
But now one final thing.
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before, then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.
Suddenly and for the very first time, collective defense, the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations, is no longer enough.
It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe; if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe; my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.
It is no longer the case.
The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that, increasingly, I share a destiny with my enemy.
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s, we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them.
Collective security is not enough.
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.
They shared a destiny with their enemies.
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians, do not understand that they share a collective destiny.
And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen, what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy.
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.
The great poem of John Donne's.
"Send not for whom the bell tolls."
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
And it goes: "Every man's death affected me, for I am involved in mankind, send not to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee."
For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.
For us, I think, part of the equation for our survival.
Thank you very much.
To find the path to long life and health, Dan Buettner and team study the world's "Blue Zones," communities whose elders live with vim and vigor to record-setting age. At TEDxTC, he shares the 9 common diet and lifestyle habits that keep them spry past age 100.
Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity.
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
You have the USDA food pyramid. There is what Oprah tells us.
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better.
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu?
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
How about these hormones or resveratrol?
And does purpose play into it?
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?
Well, our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic, and the National Institute on Aging, to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined.
And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do, to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity.
And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100.
False.
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100.
Your chances are very low.
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America, it's hard to reach 100.
The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity.
We are programmed for something called procreative success.
I love that word.
It reminds me of my college days.
Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation, the age when your children have children.
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates.
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won the genetic lottery.
The second myth is, there are treatments that can help slow, reverse, or even stop aging.
False.
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes, those brain cells die, they never come back.
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage, the cartilage never comes back.
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque, and we can get Alzheimer's.
There is just too many things to go wrong.
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up.
And it builds up exponentially.
It's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape, and let our friends copy that cassette tape, and pretty soon, with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage.
Well, the same things happen to our cells.
That's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person.
So, if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging, what am I doing here?
Well, the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body, my body, your body, is about 90 years, a little bit more for women.
But life expectancy in this country is only 78.
So somewhere along the line, we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
These are years that we could get.
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them, areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are, areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years, the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country.
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people, but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
And here we have this area where men live the longest, about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100, they do so with extraordinary vigor.
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work, chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
Because the land is so infertile, they largely are shepherds, which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
Their diet is mostly plant-based, accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat, a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals, and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
It's called Cannonau.
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society.
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people.
You ever notice here in America, social equity seems to peak at about age 24?
Just look at the advertisements.
Here in Sardinia, the older you get the more equity you have, the more wisdom you're celebrated for.
You go into the bars in Sardinia, instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar, you see the centenarian of the month calendar.
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family -- it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy -- research shows it's also good for the children of those families, who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
That's called the grandmother effect.
We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet, about 800 miles south of Tokyo, on the archipelago of Okinawa.
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.
And in the northern part of the main island, this is ground zero for world longevity.
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. They have what we want.
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,
very quickly, and often, I can tell you, after sex.
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer, big killers here in America.
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us.
What do they do?
Once again, a plant-based diet, full of vegetables with lots of color in them.
And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do.
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.
They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating, which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
A few of the strategies we observed: they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
Instead of serving family style, where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking, they serve at the counter, put the food away, and then bring it to the table.
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage, which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
It was invented by Confucius.
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain.
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing.
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity.
We know that isolation kills.
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.
We're down to one and half right now.
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa, you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life.
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck, and if things go bad, child gets sick, parent dies, you always have somebody who has your back.
This particular Moai, these five ladies have been together for 97 years.
Their average age is 102.
Typically in America we've divided our adult life up into two sections.
There is our work life, where we're productive.
And then one day, boom, we retire.
And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair, or going down to Arizona to play golf.
In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement.
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life, and that word is "ikigai."
And, roughly translated, it means "the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
For this 102-year-old karate master, his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.
For this hundred-year-old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute, the people who put the questionnaire.
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.
And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.
And she put her head back and she said, "It feels like leaping into heaven."
I thought that was a wonderful thought.
My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota, where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.
But that's because all the young people left.
So, we turned to the data again.
And we found America's longest-lived population
among the Seventh-Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.
Adventists are conservative Methodists.
They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.
And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity, comparatively speaking.
In America here, life expectancy for the average woman is 80.
But for an Adventist woman, their life expectancy is 89.
And the difference is even more pronounced among men, who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their American counterparts.
Now, this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years.
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project.
This is a heterogeneous community.
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.
The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives.
They take their diet directly from the Bible.
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29], where God talks about legumes and seeds, and on one more stanza about green plants, ostensibly missing is meat.
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.
For 24 hours every week, no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work, where the kids need to be driven, they stop everything and they focus on their God, their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion, are nature walks.
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally, the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.
So, if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk, exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.
He's a multimillionaire, yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence, he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement, and hauling poles around.
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room.
But not as the guy on the table; the guy doing open-heart surgery.
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now, an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards, throw up rooster tails.
And then Marge Deton.
Marge is 104.
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.
She starts her day with lifting weights.
She rides her bicycle.
And then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 Cadillac Seville, and tears down the San Bernardino freeway, where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen.
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.
"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.
So, what are the common denominators in these three cultures?
What are the things that they all do?
And we managed to boil it down to nine.
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true.
And the first one, and I'm about to utter a heresy here, none of them exercise, at least the way we think of exercise.
Instead, they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
These 100-year-old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor, 30 or 40 times a day.
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.
Every trip to the store, or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk.
They don't have any conveniences.
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.
That's physical activity.
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.
When they do do intentional physical activity, it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk, the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline, and they all tend to have a garden.
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook.
Each of these cultures take time to downshift.
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out, that triggers something called the inflammatory response, which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease.
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state.
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose, ikigai, like the Okinawans.
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born, because of infant mortality, and the year you retire.
These people know their sense of purpose, and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy.
There's no longevity diet.
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day, not a hard sell to the American population.
They tend to eat a plant-based diet.
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.
And they have strategies to keep from overeating, little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.
They put their families first, take care of their children and their aging parents.
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community, which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month.
And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe.
They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.
We know from the Framingham studies, that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people, that's going to have a measurable impact over time.
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey, biking or gardening, if your friends drink a little, but not too much, and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy, that is going to have the biggest impact over time.
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.
Exercise programs usually start in January; they're usually done by October.
When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else.
But when you think about it, your friends are long-term adventures, and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life, and life to your years. Thank you very much.
X Prize founder Peter Diamandis talks about how he helped Stephen Hawking fulfill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g.
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier.
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
And I want to tell you that story.
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
And I met Professor Hawking, and he said his dream was to travel into space.
And I said, "I can't take you there, but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds. Come back down, you weigh twice as much.
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
We set out to do this.
It took us 11 years to become operational.
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say, you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.
And he wanted to go.
We worked hard to get all the permissions.
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
We had a press conference, we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola, give him 25 seconds of zero-g.
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities -- who flew with us.
A few TEDsters here.
We set up a whole ER.
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle takes off and lands.
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero-g.
Once he was there, [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
So we did a second parabola.
And a third.
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.
And a seventh and an eighth.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
He was so happy.
We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
Please join us in this epic adventure.
Thank you so much.
Medical animator David Bolinsky presents 3 minutes of stunning animation that show the bustling life inside a cell.
I'm a medical illustrator, and I come from a slightly different point of view.
I've been watching, since I grew up, the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences.
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date.
These are expressions of truth as awe-full things, by meaning they are things you can worship.
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible. They are unique. They are useful -- sometimes, often a long time after the fact.
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now, because I don't want to look at me on the screen.
Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand.
And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator -- since I was taught animation by my father, who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident.
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
We don't want to do that to our students.
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard, in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell -- that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on.
They could have a mental image of the cell as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro-machines.
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
These micro-machines, which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over, are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids.
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves. They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts. They power our minds.
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard, which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information, in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually, so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked, so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out, really, how life works.
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary, and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall, and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside, where they can't see and sense.
But they get the information that causes them to stop, causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape, and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on, but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening.
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced. It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years.
And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures -- these little walking machines, they're called kinesins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size.
Run the movie, please.
But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
because all of these machines interact with each other.
They pass information to each other. They cause different things to happen inside the cell.
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly, from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here, would be possible without these little micro-machines.
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines, have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell. This little guy is called the kinesin, and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell -- whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle, whether it's to build something or repair something.
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around, right now, inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
So no matter how lazy you feel, you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.
So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are. And think about some of the things that we're learning about cellular mechanics.
Once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live.
And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty.
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines, are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
And their working together helps our bodies -- huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.
Becky Blanton planned to live in her van for a year and see the country, but when depression set in and her freelance job ended, her camping trip turned into homelessness. In this intimate talk, she describes her experience of becoming one of America's working homeless.
I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person,
so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things.
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible.
I became one of the working homeless.
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel.
His death hit me pretty hard.
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip.
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things.
One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person.
Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it.
Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.
At first, living in the van was great.
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.
And I had time to relax and to grieve.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills.
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer.
And it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.
The doggy went into doggy day care.
And I sweated.
Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops. Or I washed up in public rest rooms.
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep.
Food rotted in the heat.
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable.
I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat.
And I refused to give them up,
so I stayed in the van.
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing. And they stayed there.
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
I didn't always succeed.
But I felt out of control of my life.
And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away.
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.
My talent, my integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same.
But I had changed somehow.
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
I just wasn't drunk or high.
And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did.
Then the professor listened to my story and he said, "You have a job. You have hope.
The real homeless don't have hope."
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal. And I remember thinking, "If I killed myself, no one would notice."
A friend told me, shortly after that, that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national T.V.
An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press," was talking about my writing, while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, I started laughing.
You should too.
I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.
And I cried.
Because I was a writer.
I was a writer.
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
And I started writing again.
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
I was no longer homeless.
And I was no longer invisible.
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs, and live in their cars.
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep, or what their life situation is at any given time.
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
and today I'm speaking at TED.
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.
At TEDxChange, Thailand's "Mr. Condom," Mechai Viravaidya, walks us through the country's bold plan to raise its standard of living, starting in the 1970s. First step: population control. And that means a lot of frank, funny -- and very effective -- talk about condoms.
Welcome to Thailand.
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago, the country was very, very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
We decided to do something about it, but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program.
But we began with a family-planning program, following a very successful maternal child health activity, sets of activities.
So basically, no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive.
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers, and then follow up with family planning.
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it.
In my country, that was the case in 1974.
Seven children per family --
tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
There was just no future.
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.
So we said, "Let's do it."
The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills, but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"
and we had very, very few doctors.
We didn't take no as an answer; we took no as a question.
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women, and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill.
That was wonderful, but it covered only 20 percent of the country.
What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
No, we decided to do a bit more.
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
Actually, below that yellow sign -- I wish they hadn't wiped that, because there was "Coca-Cola" there.
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
And no difference, the people they chose were the people we chose.
They were well-known in the community, they knew that customers were always right, and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country.
So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution.
Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women, selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people, you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.
And then we decided, why not get to religion because in the Philippines, the Catholic Church was pretty strong, and Thai people were Buddhist.
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow -- holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family.
And this picture was sent throughout the country.
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
It's been blessed."
That was their perception.
And then we went to teachers.
You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place.
So we went to the teachers.
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy.
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
Very good, mother. Move ahead.
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."
Again, education, class entertainment.
And the kids were doing it in school too.
We had relay races with condoms,
we had children's condom-blowing championship.
And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --
so the condom is the girl's best friend.
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, "We only want to lend to women who practice family planning.
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us." And that was run by them.
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on.
It's a part of the Village Development Bank;
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --
it was run by the villagers themselves.
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,
it's always women, women, women, women.
And then we thought we'd help America, because America's been helping everyone, whether they want help or not.
And this is on the Fourth of July.
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his [unclear].
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --
very appropriate room.
And since it was near lunch time, they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
Of course, it must be American cola.
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog." And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.
And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID.
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."
And what happened?
In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children,
population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --
it was exactly the same thing.
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola, but we're good friends.
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.
But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior.
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS.
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
So our work wasn't affected.
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.
They have more than the government, and they've got more guns than the government.
So I asked them, could they help us in our fight against HIV.
And after I gave them statistics,
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."
And that's when we went onto the airwaves.
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
So I said, "Okay."
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold.
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --
everyone -- and we said the public, institutions, religious institutions, schools -- everyone was involved.
And here, every media person had to be trained for HIV.
And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money.
So they were happy with that.
And then AIDS education in all schools, starting from university.
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,
and they were terrific.
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa.
And then we went down one more step.
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade -- going to every household in the village, every household in the whole of Thailand, giving AIDS information and a condom to every household, given by these young kids.
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives, and this was a lifesaver.
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."
So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
So they all trained.
And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots. And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.
In every country, every program, you need a symbol, and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere, everywhere.
In taxis, you get condoms.
And also, in traffic, the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.
So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;
I see them standing around right now, everywhere.
Imagine if they had condoms, giving out to all sorts of people.
And then, new change, we had hair bands, clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season.
And these were the condoms that we introduced.
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."
We found --
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
And then it says here, with the American flag, "Don't leave home without it."
But I have some to give out afterward.
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized, so be very careful.
And so you can see that condoms can do so many things.
Look at this --
I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
Stop global warming; use condoms.
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection.
And let the next Olympics save some lives.
Why just run around?
And then finally, in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,
so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust." So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people.
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools, because alcohol impairs judgment.
And then what happened?
After all this time, everybody joined in.
According to the U.N., new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent,
and according to the World Bank, 7.7 million lives were saved.
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.
There was political commitment, some financial commitment, and everybody joined in the fight.
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
We all need to help.
And then we decided to help people out of poverty, now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way -- this time, not with government alone, but in cooperation with the business community.
Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit.
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs, little business people.
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
So, that was done.
The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting.
It's not a free gift.
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank.
Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in.
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.
And we believe if you want to help the poor, those who are living in poverty, access to credit must be a human right.
Access to credit must be a human right.
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA," teaching people how to do business so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
These are some of the businesses: mushrooms, crabs, vegetables, trees, fruits, and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;
this is a village sponsored by Nike.
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
Make these better, because we can afford them."
And then we have silk, Thai silk.
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left, to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.
So anyone sitting in and watching TV, get in touch with me.
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- "Coffee and Condoms."
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
That's the difference.
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms?
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.
And then now, finally in education, we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development. And it's a center, a focal point for economic and social development.
Re-do the school, make it serve the community needs.
And here is a bamboo building --
all of them are bamboo.
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome.
And we use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables.
And then, finally, I firmly believe, if we want the MDGs to work -- the Millennium Development Goals -- we need to add family planning to it. Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --
everyone needs family planning service --
it's underutilized.
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives.
And then, finally, that is our network.
And these are our Thai tulips.
Thank you very much indeed.
Author and activist Isabel Allende discusses women, creativity, the definition of feminism -- and, of course, passion -- in this talk.
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart.
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
There's a Jewish saying that I love. What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity.
All stories interest me, and some haunt me until I end up writing them.
Certain themes keep coming up: justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues, freedom.
I'm aware of the mystery around us, so I write about coincidences, premonitions, emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.
In the last 20 years I have published a few books, but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006, when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's, and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,
of the opening ceremony, called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers.
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker.
I was told that this was no laughing matter. This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag.
Five women, representing five continents, and three Olympic gold medal winners.
My first question was, naturally, what was I going to wear?
A uniform, she said, and asked for my measurements.
My measurements.
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak, looking like the Michelin Man.
By the middle of February, I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind, can determine the result of a race or a game.
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
It is all about passion.
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics.
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.
That is what I need for my characters in my books: a passionate heart.
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels, who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
People like all of you in this room.
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.
They only make good former spouses. In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers: three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren. Also, two women with passionate hearts:
Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so, she has changed the soil, the weather, in some places in Africa, and of course the economic conditions in many villages.
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution.
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS. And of brothels where children are forced to receive five, 15 clients per day, and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
In the green room I received my uniform. It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear, but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
I looked like a refrigerator.
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren, the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
I don't know.
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight, and I don't make old people's noises."
So, there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth.
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting.
Well, she didn't say that exactly.
At some point around midnight, we were summoned to the wings of the stadium, and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started -- by the way, the same music that starts here, the Aida March.
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am, not counting the poofy hair.
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah, holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia. That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.
A place where most men would love to be.
The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium.
My husband is offended when I say this --
although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes --
-- so he shouldn't take it personally.
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes, because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells.
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics -- passion.
So here's a tale of passion. The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo.
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls.
We can call this place in Congo a death camp, because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
The protagonists of this story are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
She's pregnant and a widow.
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed.
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive, and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
Two tiny little boys.
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick, and ties it with her own hair.
She names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them.
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter, she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go, even when they hold a gun to her head.
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months, and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff, who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona, where they're now living and thriving.
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo.
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.
I look around and I see them everywhere.
I have worked with women and for women all my life.
I know them well.
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --
although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received, I was able to deliver two.
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties, she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor --
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.
They have no education and no freedom.
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
For most Western young women of today, being called a feminist is an insult.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting, and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
Feminism is not dead, by no means.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake.
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
The year is 2005.
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation.
She's prepared to clean teeth, but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors, no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
Outside, there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated.
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars.
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
She risks a lot and she's terrified.
She doesn't even have the proper instruments,
but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic, her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon. It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.
Jenny is horrified at what she has done, but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him. Millions of women live like this today.
They are the poorest of the poor.
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor, they own less than one percent of the world's assets.
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence,
and they are constantly threatened by exploitation, violence and abuse.
It is a fact that giving women education, work, the ability to control their own income, inherit and own property, benefits the society.
If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off.
If families prosper, the village prospers, and eventually so does the whole country.
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees.
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them, drop by drop.
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest, the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down.
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy.
For every dollar given to a women's program, 20 dollars are given to men's programs.
Women are 51 percent of humankind.
Empowering them will change everything --
more than technology and design and entertainment.
I can promise you that women working together -- linked, informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians, mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.
What kind of world do we want?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody, not only for the privileged.
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings at the UC Berkeley library.
No museum or gallery in the United States, except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work, has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison.
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power, in the voluminous Botero style.
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart.
What I fear most is power with impunity. I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
In our species, the alpha males define reality, and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules.
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,
and in this case, the trickle-down effect, which does not work in economics, works perfectly.
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child.
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender, income, race, and class.
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization.
But for real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world.
We need a critical number of women in positions of power, and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts.
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
I want to make this world good.
Not better, but to make it good.
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves and get to work, passionately, in creating an almost perfect world.
Thank you.
Every day, in a city the size of London, 30 million meals are served. But where does all the food come from? Architect Carolyn Steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city, and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world.
How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes,
but few of us ever get to see them.
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
And it's an escalating problem too.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.
So how did we get here?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process
in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.
This is no accident,
because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers. Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really.
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,
and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold,
which is why it's called Poultry.
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,
and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,
because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.
Here we have food -- that used to be the center, the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
So what are we going to do about that?
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia." And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,
even though More never framed it that way.
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City." Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,
little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, "sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
I believe we already live in Sitopia.
We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either,
because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture,
which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.
Weeks from the Charter for Compassion launch, Karen Armstrong looks at religion's role in the 21st century: Will its dogmas divide us? Or will it unite us for common good? She reviews the catalysts that can drive the world's faiths to rediscover the Golden Rule.
For years I've been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths.
Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule.
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
And equally important is the negative version -- "Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
Look into your own heart,
discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works.
People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, "all day and every day," not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself.
And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.
that this was so central to the religious life. Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.
I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead.
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
Now why was I so grateful to TED?
Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century,
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.
The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace.
And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem.
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
And we need to revive that spirit.
And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down.
We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced.
Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.
In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,
and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically.
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people, young people, and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art.
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
Religious teaching must always lead to action.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
And I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion.
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody.
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it.
You also have to do it.
I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another.
The same applies to educators.
I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle.
And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. And perhaps above all, to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking,
so that because people have this Charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them, they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders, from the captains of industry.
Because we can change the world,
we have the ability.
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement.
And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world.
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable. But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis.
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
It's in his book "The Four Loves."
He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes. And then he compared that to friendship, when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder, with their eyes fixed on a common goal.
We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends.
And I am convinced. I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey, that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences melt away.
And we learn amity.
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
Thank you very much.
David Macaulay relives the winding and sometimes surreal journey toward the completion of Rome Antics, his illustrated homage to the historic city.
I draw to better understand things.
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work," while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding, spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.
Who knew about extension managers?
I've always managed my own extensions
so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,
but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out, because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,
so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would.
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for, something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here, or I could talk about something I really care about.
I decided to go with the latter.
I'm going to talk about Rome.
Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year, in Rome as a student. It changed my life.
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home, driving into RISD everyday, driving back.
I missed the '60s. I read about them; I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,
but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,
and it's a place that is never far from my mind.
So, whenever given an opportunity, I try to do something in it or with it or for it.
I also make drawings to help people understand things.
Things that I want them to believe I understand.
And that's what I do as an illustrator,
that's my job.
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --
I need to.
All different materials, all different styles, all different times,
drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.
Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
These are sketches of some of the little details.
Rome is a city full of surprises.
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,
we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas -- never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new, the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of usually blue -- especially in the summer -- compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets.
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.
How could I share my sense of Rome, my understanding of Rome?
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency.
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;
maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.
And here's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
Maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this.
Maybe I should get away from this map completely, and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome
and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.
But even though I just started this presentation, this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate.
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on, so I decided to move towards packaging.
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.
But one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of Rome.
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.
Quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow
walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion. Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions
so I could actually use it as a scale that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.
This thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler -- sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is, but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla, and so on and so forth. If you were interested.
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,
she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --
she's assembling the structure,
Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.
Over the Spanish Steps we go.
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.
Unfortunately, just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression, as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius, which is really no more than a pile of quarters
high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio, completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside a spectacular place to visit.
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually, extraordinary blue sky.
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside.
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole, getting a different kind of perspective, moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.
Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon, and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of Rome, which would, from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo, that little spiral structure you see there.
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant, is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori, which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,
which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon, and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto, Ajax makes a lunge for it.
She's managed to save the prosciutto, but in the process she loses the tablecloth, which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
They continue without their tablecloth, looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.
They eventually discover a huge wall that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible because you've got a place to tie up.
Turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,
so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view.
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse
and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius, which has this lightning rod on top.
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close, and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes.
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy, but he's not due at work until about noon.
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace, down the alleys, through the streets that tourists may be wandering through,
disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image, which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top, one of which is upside down in this image.
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
Waiter catches on, but it's too late.
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,
but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.
Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself, or we find it.
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda, in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.
Marcello, as it turns out, is the driver of the number 64 bus,
and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
He's looking at his table;
he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years,
and he wants it to be perfect.
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.
But he's not happy; something's wrong.
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip, but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.
Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment, actually; he's in television.
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.
So they all have his number.
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian, who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;
nobody's TVs are working
and there's a big soccer game coming up, and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring, and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building, apartment by apartment, checking every television, checking every connection, hoping to find out what this problem is.
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth wrapped around the building's television antenna.
He removes it, the problems are solved, everybody in the palazzo is happy.
And of course, he also solves his own problem.
All he has to do now, with a perfect table, is wait for her to arrive.
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No,
I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,
so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
Now that's one drawing,
so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher.
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope.
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information, it's a series of layers.
I mean, you always peel one layer off another; we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers, vertical layers --
and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if I got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down.
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.
You can see that in 1635, it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever.
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.
But more importantly, I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks, or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco, which is more often the case.
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --
double foldout page -- which, if you were like me reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.
You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.
And I've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages.
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.
Here's a book completely wide open.
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,
and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.
And if I turn the book the other way, we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
No foldouts, no tricks -- just a book that isn't open the whole way.
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.
So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth.
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track, but it sort of lost its human quality.
So I went back to the notion of story, which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.
If it was a homing pigeon, it would be called "Homer's Odyssey."
But it was the journey of the ...
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome.
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back, the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting
and there's no way this pigeon can get home. So it's a homeless pigeon now
and it's going to have to find another place to live, and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,
and we start with the tall ones and so on.
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;
that's not always a good thing, but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
And I thought, that's sort of interesting, but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.
So I kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --
and they become really friends with this guy, and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
There's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons.
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --
he lives in this little garret --
and they spell his name and fly around.
And he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof,
and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city.
And I forgot to mention this: whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city.
In the old Roman custom, the dead were never buried within the walls.
And I thought that's a really cheery story. . That's really going to go a long way.
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work and if the stories aren't going anywhere, I just come up with titles
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.
And sometimes it does focus me enough
and I'll even do a title page.
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.
If you see the red line, you are seeing the trail of the pigeon;
if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point, to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving.
Past the Pyramid of Cestius -- these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --
past the gatehouse.
This is something that's a little bit unusual.
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do: it takes the scenic route, which was a device that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages.
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese -- designed by Michelangelo, built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.
This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective.
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable, you've succeeded.
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;
a couple are on Mars and a couple of others in Cremona.
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace, where invariably a soccer game is going on, and we're hit by a soccer ball.
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.
I have all the pieces: there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball, there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,
so I had to rethink it.
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace, these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way.
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower -- one of the few remaining medieval towers -- towards the church of Sant'Agnese and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona -- which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times; there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --
and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,
stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus of the Pantheon to catch our breath.
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,
so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu; it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo, which is our destination.
Straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic, where somebody is working at the drawing board.
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.
As we look at the drawing board, we see what he's working on is, in fact, a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken, and the red line extends through all the sights.
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding, all you have to do is read these paragraphs.
Thank you very much.
MIT researcher Skylar Tibbits works on self-assembly -- the idea that instead of building something , we can create materials that build themselves, much the way a strand of DNA zips itself together. It's a big concept at early stages; Tibbits shows us three in-the-lab projects that hint at what a self-assembling future might look like.
Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors. You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 --
it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.
Legendary scientist David Deutsch puts theoretical physics on the back burner to discuss a more urgent matter: the survival of our species. The first step toward solving global warming, he says, is to admit that we have a problem.
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history.
And that is that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever, is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on.
And we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go.
Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed for most of human history, human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
Now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place, uniquely suited and so on, and
the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.
And they are. So let me start with the second one: Typical. Well -- is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know, and look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum -- -- and that's not typical of the universe at all.
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the sun, the solar system, and the stars and so on.
But that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies.
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
And at this point we've come 100,000 light years from here.
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space.
And so what does that look like? Typical.
What does a typical place in the universe look like?
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space.
So can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
Well, not quite, not quite perfect -- you see, in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.
It's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
That's how big and how dark the universe is.
And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years.
And yet from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
It's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero.
And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently
create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place.
And that is how un-typical this place is.
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
Now how do we know about an environment that's so far away, and so different, and so alien, from anything we're used to?
Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us -- is creating knowledge.
Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars.
They're called "quasars." Quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object.
Which means things that look a bit like stars. But they're not stars.
And we know what they are. Billions of years ago, and billions of light years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole.
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse. And some of the matter, back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion suns.
Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe, and model, and predict, and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality.
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.
Now that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge.
So, the laws of physics have this special property. That physical objects, as unlike each other as they could possibly be, can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time.
So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality.
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this, or even mandate that this can happen, is one of the most important things about the physical world.
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment, in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics. There's no special dispensation, no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer without matter.
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.
And then thirdly, less tangible, but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence.
Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.
We happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity about 300 years ago.
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences.
As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet.
Our location is saturated with evidence, and also with matter and energy.
Out in intergalactic space, those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply.
As I said, it's empty; it's cold; and it's dark out there. Or is it?
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.
But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
And the same -- well, if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply, because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence?
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses. But all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars, and planets. In those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics, and learn the laws of physics.
And locally there you could build particle accelerators, and learn elementary particle physics, and chemistry, and so on.
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much, and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.
So in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube, anywhere in the universe, could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
So we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations, then so is almost every other environment. So is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth.
And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources, because they're plentiful, but knowledge, which is scarce.
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and I think ought to -- make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them.
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away, and we'll all be dead!
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
Now I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in.
But I do agree with him about this. We can survive, and we can fail to survive.
But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time.
Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.
And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species, and our civilization, from all the others --
namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,
our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.
So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
And the controversy is global warming.
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster.
Because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,
merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die.
Now the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster, and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself, then there's not going to be much argument, really.
But no precautions, and no precautionary principle, can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature, and with plans to live at the higher temperature --
and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away, and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
At the moment, these things are fringe research.
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem, or problems in general.
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival.
So take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
On one of them, carve: "Problems are soluble."
And on the other one carve: "Problems are inevitable."
Thank you.
Genomics pioneer Craig Venter takes a break from his epic round-the-world expedition to talk about the millions of genes his team has discovered so far in its quest to map the ocean’s biodiversity.
At the break, I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate.
And this will be my only comment on it.
And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves.
It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae.
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome.
Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred.
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet.
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass.
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses.
Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it.
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
We started in Bermuda for our test project,
then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean.
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters,
and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours.
And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries.
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments.
It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication.
From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.
We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City.
And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time.
Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean.
Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients.
So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species.
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
And these vary tremendously from region to region.
Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light.
But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes.
Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes.
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families?
And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.
When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.
And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families.
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution.
And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components.
Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, "I heart my genitalium."
This is actually just a microorganism.
But it has roughly 500 genes.
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system?
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code.
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those "non-essential genes."
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms.
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so.
So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500.
The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult.
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology.
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do.
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology.
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area.
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations.
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made.
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections.
The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents.
If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade.
So we're now making several dozen different constructs, because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome.
The key is, how do you put all of the others?
We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome.
This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there.
This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation.
The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier.
Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
The chromosome is literally blown apart.
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later.
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that, and we probably have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that.
After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome.
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back.
So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products.
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called "Combinatorial Genomics," because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability.
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach.
We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process.
We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol.
Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes.
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce.
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
Every major religion participated in this.
It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them.
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this, to work out what the risk and benefits to society are, and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
These are complex issues.
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism, they're very simple issues in terms of, can we design things to produce clean energy, perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes.
Thank you very much.
How can a struggling country break out of poverty if it's trapped in a system of bad rules? Economist Paul Romer unveils a bold idea: "charter cities," city-scale administrative zones governed by a coalition of nations.
Take a look at this picture.
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city
because they don't have any electricity at home.
Now, I haven't met these particular students,
but I've met students like them.
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.
So here is the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone, but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology for generating electric light in the home?
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson.
What kinds of rules?
The electric company in this nation operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low, subsidized price --
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives, to hook up many other users.
The president wanted to change this rule.
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,
rules where businesses earn a small profit, so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
The president has seen how those rules worked well.
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,
but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win-win solution help his country.
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out how we can change rules.
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical,
which is that, if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders -- who, in many countries, are also people. But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader, a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity, takes away a choice that people in the economy want.
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power.
So if you give just to one side or the other, you'll have tension or friction.
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps.
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.
And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
In particular check out Asia.
If you zoom in here, you can see North Korea, in outline here, which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
Now, you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark.
But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations, but also in the deeper senses of understandings, norms, culture, values and beliefs.
When they separated, they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules.
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other, for better, or for worse.
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean. Zoom in on Haiti, in outline here.
Haiti is also dark, compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic, which has about the same number of residents.
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico, which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak.
It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
So that if we want to create environments with good rules, we can't just tear down.
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.
Now, China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules.
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart, China was the world's high-technology leader.
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder. But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period, effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world.
So as other countries in the world innovated, in the sense both of developing newer technologies, but also developing newer rules, the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
Income there stayed stagnant, as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
This next chart looks at more recent data.
It plots income, average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States.
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
But then in the late '70s something changed.
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States.
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. The brightest spot in China, which you can see on the edge of the outline here, is Hong Kong.
Hong Kong was a small bit of China that, for most of the 20th century, operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China -- rules that were copied from working market economies of the time, and administered by the British.
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go, from the mainland, to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
But, to get on a process of increasing income, increasing skills led to very rapid growth there.
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy, when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model.
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people.
So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model, they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do, in a sense, what Britain did: make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there.
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:
zones where Chinese could come and work, and cities grew up very rapidly there; also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things.
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm that made the iPhone that many of you have, and they made it with labor from Chinese who moved there to Shenzhen.
So after the four special zones, there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense,
and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to, that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy.
Now the Chinese example shows us several points.
One is: preserve choices for people.
Two: operate on the right scale.
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that, but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules.
On the other hand, the nation is too big.
If you try to change the rules in the nation, you can't give some people a chance to hold back, see how things turn out, and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
But cities give you this opportunity to create new places, with new rules that people can opt in to.
And they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules.
So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city.
We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
We'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure --
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
You'll need to attract firms, who will come hire the people who move there first.
And you'll need to attract families, the residents who will come and live there permanently, raise their children, get an education for their children, and get their first job.
With that charter, people will move there.
The city can be built.
And we can scale this model.
We can go do it over and over again.
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
Those are captured in the charter.
We also need the choices for people.
That's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land.
You start from uninhabited territory.
People can come live under the new charter,
but no one is forced to live under it.
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:
cases where nations work together, in effect, de facto, the way China and Britain worked together to build, first a little enclave of the market model, and then scale it throughout China.
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently, through its actions in Hong Kong, did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century.
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again, we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility, a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities. Now, when I say that, some of you are starting to think, "Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?" It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things, can get in the way, can make us pull back, can shut down our ability, and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
Why is this not like colonialism?
The thing that was bad about colonialism, and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs, is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension.
This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
It must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China, but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status.
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay, where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem. They want to get out.
Why don't you, Canada, take over?
Build -- run a special administrative zone. Allow a new city to be built up there. Allow many people to come in.
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.
Others will hold back. But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country." Now, where else might this model be tried?
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule. It's a rule for changing rules.
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
They also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --
the kind of investors who will come build the port, build the roads, in a new city --
they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation.
Perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account, where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built.
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
There are immense stretches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live.
Now, if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --
cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century --
is there enough land for them?
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night, the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks like most of the world is already built out.
So let me show you why that's wrong.
Take this representation of all of the land.
Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth.
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in.
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this.
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to.
And if these are cities governed by good rules, they can be cities where people are safe from crime, safe from disease and bad sanitation, where people have a chance to get a job.
They can get basic utilities like electricity.
Their kids can get an education.
So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities, scaling this so we build many more?
It would help to have a manual.
What university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual.
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities, go out and design them.
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild.
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like, suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro.
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant, and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
How would we write the treaty to do that?
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
How would we finance this?
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police, the courts,
but the school system and the health care system too, which make this a more attractive place to live,
makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it, and set up the basic rules, go very much in the right direction.
So there are many other details like this.
How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,
but make those buildings energy efficient, and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane.
Many technical details to be worked out, but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock, there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination, that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution.
Let me conclude with this picture.
The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas.
We can share ideas with other people, and when they discover them, they share with us.
It's not like scarce objects, where sharing means we each get less.
When we share ideas we all get more.
When we think about ideas in that way, we usually think about technologies.
But there is another class of ideas: the rules that govern how we interact with each other;
rules like, let's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free. Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office, that people can pledge as collateral. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules, and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules, so we don't get stuck with bad rules, then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place, so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.
Psychologist Philip Zimbardo says happiness and success are rooted in a trait most of us disregard: the way we orient toward the past, present and future. He suggests we calibrate our outlook on time as a first step to improving our lives.
I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time, in a very short time.
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.
Keep it quiet please. Settle down.
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.
15 seconds studio.
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two ...
Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."
"I don't know, guys.
I don't want to get in trouble."
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus.
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
And most of them did so without using birth control.
So much for promises.
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford, went back 14 years later, to try to discover what was different about those kids.
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways.
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today, the key for you, is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.
Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories.
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.
They vary between cultures, between nations, between individuals, between social classes, between education levels.
And the problem is that they can become biased,
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.
What determines any decision you make?
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling.
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them "present-oriented,"
because their focus is what is now.
For others, the present is irrelevant.
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
So that their decisions are based on past memories.
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future.
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.
Cost-benefit analysis.
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.
So, time paradox, I want to argue, the paradox of time perspective, is something that influences every decision you make, you're totally unaware of.
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.
You can be present-hedonistic, namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --
it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.
Or you can be transcendental future: namely, life begins after death.
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation, that's what you've got to learn to do.
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.
And moderate on present-hedonism.
And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism.
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.
What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations, new challenges.
What you get from the present hedonism is the energy, the energy to explore yourself, places, people, sensuality.
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
What do futures sacrifice for success?
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
And they live for work, achievement and control.
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.
And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto, a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.
I'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.
Told me don't eat that marshmallow, because if you wait you're going to get two of them, until I learned to balance out.
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive, and I'm happier than I have ever been.
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems: changing the drop-out rates of school kids, combating addictions, enhancing teen health, curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation, reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate, altering appeals to suicidal terrorists, and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.
So I want to end by saying: many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
And the idea is so simple, so obvious, but I think the consequences are really profound.
Thank you so much.
Planetary scientist Carolyn Porco shows images from the Cassini voyage to Saturn, focusing on its largest moon, Titan, and on frozen Enceladus, which seems to shoot jets of ice.
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now, and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon, but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets, and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto, the body formerly known as a planet.
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be.
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this, there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004, and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun.
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare, and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula, which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us, and also how humans fit into that picture.
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini. I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn, and have been for the past two and a half years.
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon, and, until Cassini had arrived there, was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system.
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room, except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
But these haze particles, it was surmised, before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years, gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge.
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules, especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan. And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
It's a condensable in the atmosphere, and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK, and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze, which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills, down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth. It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner.
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people -- it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
And yet another moon there --
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
And we have taken pictures like this.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater, but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan, meaning it's a very young surface.
And there are features that look tectonic.
They look like they've been pulled apart.
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet, it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And so it's been tectonically altered.
But we couldn't make sense of our images, until, six months after we got into orbit, an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe, the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan, it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
This is a device of human making, and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case.
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission, and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany, and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents, and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words "united nations" are supposed to mean: a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet, and to come to understand a planetary system that, for all of human history, had been unreachable, and now humans had actually touched it.
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it. It was a tremendously emotional event, and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down, and it also took panoramic pictures.
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be.
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge.
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
You are looking at a shoreline.
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S., you would be flying at these altitudes.
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan.
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface, and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen, the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And here is the horizon, OK?
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw, and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
But still, there was no sign in our images, or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan, showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall, separated by a few kilometers, and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid, until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
And then, only a week and a half ago, we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again, we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand, or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like, and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity, and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon, it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright, and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures. It is a very geologically active body.
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures.
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region, has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels, we see that these jets feed a plume that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus.
My team and I have examined images like this, and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system, whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere, would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system, then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
It is precious, it is unique, it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space, and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe, and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first, a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
And in this impossibly beautiful picture, you see the main rings backlit by the Sun, you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created, in fact, by the exhalations of Enceladus.
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image, sight of our own planet, cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
Now, there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar, and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds.
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that, may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
And thank you very much.
How many of today's headlines will matter in 100 years? 1000? Kirk Citron's "Long News" project collects stories that not only matter today, but will resonate for decades -- even centuries -- to come. At TED2010, he highlights recent headlines with the potential to shape our future.
We are drowning in news.
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year.
That's just one source.
My question is: How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run?
That's the idea behind The Long News.
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation, which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside.
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,
is this going to matter in a decade?
Or this?
Or this?
Really?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
Okay, that was kind of cool.
But the top story of this past year was the economy,
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later, this particular recession is going to be old news.
So, what kind of stories might make a difference for the future?
Well, let's take science.
Someday, little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things.
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.
Some recent stories: nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;
they're sending genes into the brain;
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
What about global politics?
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda, and they may.
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market, they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter, and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers.
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.
Some recent discoveries: There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica;
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --
soon, science may no longer need us,
and life may no longer need us either;
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
It seems that with or without us, life will go on.
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one: water found on the moon.
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might, or somebody in this room might write a big check.
My point is this: In the long run, some news stories are more important than others.
As of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped. This slows the delivery of aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and unknown roads. In this short talk, Google's Lalitesh Katragadda demos Map Maker, a group map-making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world.
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having detailed maps.
But help was coming.
At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
And it took them four days.
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally.
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and video stores to the corner store.
Maps matter.
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.
For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere.
Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now.
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries.
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning.
This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of cities, one user, one edit at a time.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.
Welcome to the new world.
In 2003, the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves. Did you hear about it? Didn't think so. Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace.
I'm a filmmaker.
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village. They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
Let me show you some brief clips, so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.
Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.
Here in Budrus, we realized the wall would steal our land.
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror.
Man: Today you're invited to a peaceful march.
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition.
Woman: We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.
But I think the girls could do it.
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds of traditional thinking.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
Chanting: One united nation.
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.
Man: These are live bullets.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear].
Protester: This is a peaceful march.
There is no need to use violence.
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
We can do it!
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003.
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow, or even survive, in Palestine.
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue, it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.
But that's true for adults too.
In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced, depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus.
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.
So we organized a screening.
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date.
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.
So they kept on going.
On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools.
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work.
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened.
But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply.
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.
Thank you.
How do you remember where you parked your car? How do you know if you're moving in the right direction? Neuroscientist Neil Burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us, and how they link to memory and imagination.
When we park in a big parking lot, how do we remember where we parked our car?
Here's the problem facing Homer.
And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain.
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow, which is the organ of memory.
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's, you can't remember things including where you parked your car.
It's named after Latin for "seahorse," which it resembles.
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons. So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it.
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells, which are very densely interconnected.
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity, there's going to be a red dot and a click.
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location.
And if we record from lots of different neurons, we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment, like in this square box shown here.
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain, telling the brain continually, "Where am I now within my environment?" Place cells are also being recorded in humans.
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town.
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active, start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment?
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important.
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in.
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south.
And if you put another wall inside the box, then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box.
So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus.
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus, cells are found which project into the hippocampus, which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around.
So the cell on the left, you can see, it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east, whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around. And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are, like this goal flag, in simple environments -- or indeed, where your car would be.
So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember.
And then, if we put them back in the environment, generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was.
But on some trials, we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell.
In that case, we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
And what you see, for example, if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment, and then if you ask people where it was, but you've made the environment bigger, where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out.
It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location,
and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern.
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
But we also know where we are through movement.
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements, which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back.
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell.
Now grid cells are found, again, on the inputs to the hippocampus, and they're a bit like place cells.
But now as the rat explores around, each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid.
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment, and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells.
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles.
And as it moves around, the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is, so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment.
Do people have grid cells?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal.
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex, which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
So back to Homer.
He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked.
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park, which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire.
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there.
Maybe it's been towed.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
So beyond spatial memory, if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain, we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks, like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least, of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
So if this was happening, your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint.
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
Another kind of cell, head direction cells, which I didn't mention yet, they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery, so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
Thank you very much.
Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership all starting with a golden circle and the question "Why?" His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers ...
How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?
Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
For example: Why is Apple so innovative?
Year after year, after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition.
And yet, they're just a computer company.
They're just like everyone else.
They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.
Then why is it that they seem to have something different?
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?
He wasn't the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights America,
and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.
Why him?
And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded ... and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
There's something else at play here.
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked,
and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.
As it turns out, there's a pattern.
As it turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers -- they all think, act and communicate the exact same way.
And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.
All I did was codify it,
and it's probably the world's simplest idea.
I call it the golden circle.
Why? How? What?
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.
Let me define the terms really quickly.
Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent.
Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP.
But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
That's a result. It's always a result.
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
What's your cause? What's your belief?
Why does your organization exist?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
And why should anyone care?
Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in.
It's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size, regardless of their industry -- all think, act and communicate from the inside out.
Let me give you an example.
I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.
If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: "We make great computers.
They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
Want to buy one?" "Meh."
And that's how most of us communicate.
That's how most marketing is done, that's how most sales is done
and that's how most of us communicate interpersonally.
We say what we do, we say how we're different or how we're better
and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that.
Here's our new law firm:
We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,
we always perform for our clients who do business with us.
Here's our new car:
It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats, buy our car.
But it's uninspiring.
Here's how Apple actually communicates. "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.
We believe in thinking differently.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
We just happen to make great computers.
Want to buy one?"
Totally different right? You're ready to buy a computer from me.
All I did was reverse the order of the information.
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.
But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple. But, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
There's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.
Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products.
In fact, they tried.
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat screen TVs.
They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs.
They've been making flat screen monitors for years.
Nobody bought one.
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,
and they make great quality products,
and they can make perfectly well-designed products --
and nobody bought one.
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell.
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?
But we do it every day.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.
The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
Here's the best part:
None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.
It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.
Not psychology, biology.
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down, what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the "what" level.
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,
and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty.
It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures.
It just doesn't drive behavior.
When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.
This is where gut decisions come from.
You know, sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right."
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language.
And the best we can muster up is, "I don't know. It just doesn't feel right."
Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart, or you're leading with your soul.
Well, I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior.
It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
But if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do.
Again, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if you hire people who believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
And nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the Wright brothers.
Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
Everybody was trying it.
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success.
I mean, even now, you ask people, "Why did your product or why did your company fail?"
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine.
Money was no problem.
He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;
he knew all the big minds of the day.
He hired the best minds money could find
and the market conditions were fantastic.
The New York Times followed him around everywhere,
and everyone was rooting for Langley.
Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.
They had no money;
they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop;
not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur;
and The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
He was in pursuit of the result.
He was in pursuit of the riches.
And lo and behold, look what happened.
The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.
The others just worked for the paycheck.
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper.
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it.
We found out about it a few days later.
And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: The day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit.
He could have said, "That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous so he quit.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
And if you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation,
and if you don't know the law, you definitely know the terminology.
The first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators.
The next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters.
The next 34 percent are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards.
The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.
We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration,
and then the system tips.
And I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
And they love to tell you, "Oh, it's about 10 percent," proudly.
Well, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.
We all have about 10 percent who just "get it."
That's how we describe them, right?
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."
The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it?
So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" --
because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first.
And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters, they're comfortable making those gut decisions.
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available.
These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf.
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard.
And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great;
they did it for themselves.
It's because they wanted to be first.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it
and what you do simply proves what you believe.
In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.
The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them:
They were first.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.
First, the famous failure.
It's a commercial example.
As we said before, a second ago, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions,
right? You should have success then.
Look at TiVo.
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute.
They were extremely well-funded.
Market conditions were fantastic.
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.
I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time.
But TiVo's a commercial failure.
They've never made money.
And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes.
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had.
They said, "We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking."
And the cynical majority said, "We don't believe you.
We don't need it. We don't like it.
You're scaring us."
What if they had said, "If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you.
It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,
and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.
Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.
In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak.
They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date.
How do you do that?
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator.
He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America.
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.
But he had a gift.
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
He went around and told people what he believed.
"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.
And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.
And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people.
And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak.
How many of them showed up for him?
Zero.
They showed up for themselves.
It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.
It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:
25 percent of the audience was white.
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man.
And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world.
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.
We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.
And, by the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech, not the "I have a plan" speech.
Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.
They're not inspiring anybody.
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
Leaders hold a position of power or authority,
but those who lead inspire us.
Whether they're individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to.
We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.
And it's those who start with "why" that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.
Thank you very much.
