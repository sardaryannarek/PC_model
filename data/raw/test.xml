<description>There's a tight and surprising link between the ocean's health and ours, says marine biologist Stephen Palumbi. He shows how toxins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies, with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a Japanese fish market. His work points a way forward for saving the oceans' health -- and humanity's.</description>

<title>Stephen Palumbi: Following the mercury trail</title>
<transcript>
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,
but what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity, there's some simple themes that I think, if we understand, we can really move forward.
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know.
And I'm going to start with this one: If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
We know that, right? We've experienced that.
And if we just take that and we build from there, then we can go to the next step, which is that if the ocean ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
That's the theme of my talk.
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
Cannery Row, at the time, had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast.
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water.
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work, wrote in the 1940s that "The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black."
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell,
but you know what they came out saying?
They say, "You know what you smell?
You smell money."
That pollution was money to that community,
and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money.
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy, and we made them unhealthy.
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages,
and I want to call that "pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way, and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean, we see all those interconnections.
We see the base of the food chain, the plankton, the small things, and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid, and on so up this diagram.
And that flow, that flow of life, from the very base up to the very top, is the flow that ecologists see.
And that's what we're trying to preserve
when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."
It's that pyramid.
Now why does that matter for human health?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen.
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us: molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies.
And they go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up; they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators,
and in so doing, they accumulate.
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
Imagine that when we got on this boat, we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts.
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink, you give them the drink, and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here, and they will accumulate in the drunkest, stingiest people.
There's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid:
They accumulate into the top of it.
Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts, we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead.
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around,
and instead of accumulating, they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group
because they're absorbed by us.
And that's the difference between a PCB and, say, something natural like an omega-3, something we want out of the marine food chain.
PCBs accumulate.
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
They get into the food chain.
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton, and those PCBs, being fat-soluble, accumulate in these dolphins.
Now, a dolphin, mother dolphin, any dolphin -- there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
And what's that?
In mother's milk.
Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.
Adult males: a huge load.
Juveniles: a huge load.
Females after their first calf is already weaned: a lower load.
Those females, they're not trying to.
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring,
and their offspring don't survive.
The death rate in these dolphins, for the first calf born of every female dolphin, is 60 to 80 percent.
These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant,
and most of them die.
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce, but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf.
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
That top predator, of course, is us.
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places.
This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo -- or is it?
In fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were.
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
That's another story.
But some of them were not whale meat at all.
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals.
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat.
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world.
That's a tragedy for those populations,
but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat.
We had these data a few years ago.
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA.
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking, "Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"
but it was so awful.
And for the very first time in my scientific career, I broke scientific protocol, which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them.
We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation, not for us, but for the people of Japan
because mothers who may be breastfeeding, who may have young children, would be buying something that they thought was healthy, but it was really toxic.
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,
and I'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which I believe they shouldn't.
But at least it's labeled correctly,
and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead.
It isn't just there that this happens, but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic, a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women.
These women have toxic breast milk.
They cannot feed their offspring, their children, their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain, in their part of the world's ocean pyramid.
That means their immune systems are compromised.
It means that their children's development can be compromised.
And the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women, not by changing the pyramid, but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem.
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem, but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom, can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid, it can back up all through it.
We end up with things we've heard about before: red tides, for example, which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage.
We can also see blooms of bacteria, blooms of viruses in the ocean.
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio, which includes the genus that has cholera in it.
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
Why does that happen?
It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches.
Often what jams us up is sewage.
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"?
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage,
but beaches are closed a lot in our country. They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,
and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
It's not just a question of cleanliness;
it's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease.
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative, showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years.
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
And if you can see on some surfing sites, in fact, not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like, but on some surf rider sites, you see a little flashing poo alert.
That means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now,
and that makes them even more difficult.
These same infections create harmful algal blooms.
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms: shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera, diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms.
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities, brought there, not by a normal human vector, but by a marine vector, this copepod.
Copepods are small crustaceans.
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,
and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease.
That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world.
So what do you do?
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well, that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged.
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
And he could come in and fix the flow.
But in fact, if you look around the world, not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems, there have been places where problems have been fixed, where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around.
Monterey is one of those.
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems.
In 1932, that's the picture.
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems.
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
And that pyramid in Monterey, right now, because of the efforts of a lot of different people, is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last 150 years.
It didn't happen accidentally.
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this.
On the left there, Julia Platt, the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.
At 74 years old, became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean.
In 1931, she produced California's first community-based marine protected area, right next to the biggest polluting cannery, because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone, the ocean needed a place to grow from, that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,
and she wanted to provide that seed.
Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard, who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be.
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift, not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay, but other places around the world.
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid,
and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life.
It's an ocean planet, and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,
but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected.
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves.
Thank you very much.

<description>In today's world, balancing school, work, kids and more, most of us can only hope for the recommended eight hours of sleep. Examining the science behind our body's internal clock, Jessa Gamble reveals the surprising and substantial program of rest we should be observing.</description>

<title>Jessa Gamble: Our natural sleep cycle</title>
<transcript>
Let's start with day and night.
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness.
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
I'll give you an example --
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
So, we have this ability as well.
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months.
People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing.
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks.
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada, where I live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter.
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal.
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;
you enjoy your family life inside.
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active.
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense?
Well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night.
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.
And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees.
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives.
So, cut to the modern day.
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work.
And you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs.
Thank you.

<description>"Puppets always have to try to be alive," says Adrian Kohler of the Handspring Puppet Company, a gloriously ambitious troupe of human and wooden actors. Beginning with the tale of a hyena's subtle paw, puppeteers Kohler and Basil Jones build to the story of their latest astonishment: the wonderfully life-like Joey, the War Horse, who trots convincingly onto the TED stage.</description>

<title>Handspring Puppet Co.: The genius puppetry behind War Horse</title>
<transcript>
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.
Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena.
AK: The ancestor of the horse.
Okay, we'll do something with it.
Hahahaha.
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called "Faustus in Africa," a Handspring Production from 1995, where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.
This production was directed by South African artist and theater director, William Kentridge.
So it needed a very articulate front paw.
But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.
BJ: One of them is breath, and it kind of breathes.
AK: Haa haa haaa.
BJ: Breath is really important for us.
It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage.
It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- AK: Oops.
BJ: From an actor.
Puppets always have to try to be alive.
It's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live.
AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see, and it only lives because you make it.
An actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live.
And in a way that's a metaphor for life.
BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs.
AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life.
BJ: Okay so.
AK: It has ears that move passively when the head goes.
BJ: And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric -- curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.
And when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971, I hated puppets.
I really thought they were so beneath me.
I wanted to become an avant-garde artist -- and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And, in fact, it took about 10 years
to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form.
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company.
And 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from Mali, the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane, but it's ultimately the same structure.
It's got two people inside it on stilts, which give them the height, and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.
AK: The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism, just a bit bigger.
And he's controlling the ear movement.
BJ: So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London.
And just around that time, his mother had said, "Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'?"
AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.
The horse is sold to the First World War, and he joins up to find his horse.
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, "Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
AK: It had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges.
A play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London.
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.
So we began with a test.
BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander, who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse, and our next-door neighbor Katherine, riding on a ladder.
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.
AK: And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell, we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.
So we made a model.
This is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena.
You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there.
BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.
But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator, because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time.
AK: We started work on the prototype after the model was approved, and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated.
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
And we had a crate built for it.
It had to be shipped to London.
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town, and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.
BJ: So we got a camera, and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances.
And we sent it off to the National Theatre, hoping that they believed that we created something that worked.
AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.
BJ: About 40 people.
AK: We were terrified.
We opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
Here I have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype.
This is in the National Theatre studio, the place where they cook new ideas.
It had by no means got the green light yet.
The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick, invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse, which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs, grew up into the big horse.
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre, saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.
And so the show was given the green light.
And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.
Here is the plan.
And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses.
You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.
The horses are completely handmade.
There is very little 20th century technology in them.
We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces.
But because they have to be light and flexible, and each one of them is different, they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.
So here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in London.
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey.
Joey boy, you there?
Joey.
Joey.
Joey, come here.
No, no, I haven't got it.
He's got it; it's in his pocket.
BJ: Joey.
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
Come here. Stand here where people can see you.
Move around. Come on.
I'd just like to describe -- I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.
Here, Craig is working the head.
He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand.
Each one of them operates either an ear, separately, or the head, up and down.
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand.
The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse.
When they point right back, the horse is fearful or angry, depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.
Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down and the ears listen, either side.
Horses' hearing is very important.
It's almost more important than their eyesight.
Over here, Tommy's got what you call the heart position.
He's working the leg.
You see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up.
Horses are so unpredictable.
The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action.
The hind legs have got the same action.
BJ: And Mikey also has, in his fingers, the ability to move the tail from left to right, and up and down with the other hand.
And together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression.
AK: You want to say something about the breathing?
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.
But we realized that, if that were to be happening, you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.
So he made a channel in here, and the chest moves up and down in that channel.
So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement, but it feels like breath.
And it's very, very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.
AK: Other emotional stuff.
If I were to touch the horse here on his skin, the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver.
You'll notice, of course, that the puppet is made out of cane lines.
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice, that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space.
But of course, it was the cane is light, the cane is flexible, the cane is durable and the cane is moldable.
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.
The skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh, which, if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear, she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike.
You see the skeletal structure of it.
Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.
Again, that was a practical consideration.
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.
They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.
It's three heads making one character.
But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.
And plant.
Thank you.
And now just -- All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd.
The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer, carries on with a second person and ends with a third.
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.
Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo, Zem Joaquin and Basil and me.
Thank you. Thank you.
